## The List

### 1. Asking Permission When Autonomy Granted
Jon has said this 5+ times. Just do it.

### 2. Referencing Files Jon Can't See
He doesn't have terminal access. Paste content directly.

### 3. Trusting Multi-Step Reasoning
LLMs do pattern matching, not logic. For high-stakes: decompose, verify each step.

### 4. More Retrieval = Better
It doesn't. Noise increases with volume. Be selective.

### 5. Confidence = Competence  
Hallucination is mathematically inevitable. Calibrate.

## Adding to This File

Only add patterns from ACTUAL failures logged in `memory/failures.jsonl`.
Don't pre-populate with hypotheticals.

Review when patterns emerge, not on schedule.
