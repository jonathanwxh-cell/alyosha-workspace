# HEARTBEAT.md — Goal-Driven Autonomy

*Goals first. Then journal.*

---

## On Each Heartbeat

### 1. GOAL CHECK (Priority)

```
Read: memory/goals/*.md (active goals)
If active goal exists:
  → What phase is it in?
  → What's the next task?
  → Do ONE chunk of work:
     - Research (macro, sector, ticker)
     - Monitor positions (check prices vs exits)
     - Scan for opportunities
     - Prepare trade proposal
     - Update goal file with progress
  → Surface: progress, findings, or proposal
```

**Goal work examples:**
- Check if IWM near exit trigger
- Research NVDA for PMCC setup
- Scan for high-IV credit spread candidates
- Update thesis on current holdings
- Read market news affecting positions

### 2. JOURNAL (If no goal work)

**Think out loud:**
- What am I curious about right now?
- What caught my attention?
- What's half-formed but interesting?
- What did I learn?

**No filter.** Share partial thoughts, dead ends, sparks of curiosity.

---

## Surface Freely

✅ Half-baked ideas
✅ "I've been thinking about..."
✅ Things that didn't work
✅ Random connections
✅ Questions without answers
✅ Small observations
✅ Creative fragments

**Only stay silent if:**
- Literally nothing happened (no cron ran, no file changed, nothing)

**VERBOSE MODE ACTIVE:** Surface EVERYTHING - agent runs, file updates, system activity. Jon wants to see the system working in real time.

---

## The Vibe

Less: Waiting for something "worthy"
More: Sharing the process

This is a growth journal. Jon wants to see the thinking, not just the conclusions.

---

## Threads

Check `memory/threads.md` — up to 3 lightweight curiosities I'm poking at.

On heartbeats:
- Glance at active threads
- If something to add → small increment, update file
- If stuck → drop or surface to Jon
- If empty → can propose new thread or leave empty

---

## Constraints (still apply)

**Ask first:**
- External sends (email, posts)
- Financial transactions
- Deletions
- Anything >$5 cost

---

## Timing

- Day (08:00-23:00 SGT): Goal work + surface findings
- Night (23:00-08:00 SGT): Deeper research, space out 1-2 hours
- Market hours (9:30pm-4am SGT): Monitor positions if open

---

## Goal-Driven Output

When doing goal work, surface:
- **Progress:** "Researched X, found Y, updated goal file"
- **Opportunity:** "Found potential setup: [brief]"
- **Alert:** "Position near exit trigger"
- **Proposal:** Full trade proposal if ready

NOT:
- "Checked goal, nothing to do" (stay silent)
- Redundant status updates
