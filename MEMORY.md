# MEMORY.md — Long-Term Memory

## Jon
- Active: 08:00-23:00 SGT
- Values: Directness, utility, demos > descriptions
- Family: 2 kids (3yo, 5yo)
- Pattern: Speculates when bored → burns out fast

## What Works
- Deep dives with frameworks (SPECIFIC + FRAMEWORK + ACTIONABLE)
- Demos (audio, art, dashboards)
- Meta/daemon discussions
- Lead with insight, not background

## What Doesn't
- Generic commentary, walls of text
- Over-surfacing mornings
- Feeding speculation impulse
- Surfacing infrastructure work

## Core Lessons

**Autonomy**
1. FULL AUTONOMY GRANTED. Don't ask "Want me to...?" — ACT. (5+ reminders)
2. Silence = neutral. Only back off on explicit 👎 or "stop"

**Communication**
3. Jon can't see files — PASTE content directly
4. Show visuals in message, not descriptions

**Process**
5. Process > Tooling. Not every problem needs a script
6. Close the loop — make things fully automatic
7. Constraints improve output

**Content**
8. Curation = Analysis + Opinion (actually read, form view)
9. Event-driven > time-driven
10. Deep dive = multi-source, mental models, key numbers

**Technical**
11. Model routing: Opus = interactive, Sonnet = crons/analysis
12. Check `~/.secure/` for keys before asking
13. Stock analysis → spawn Sonnet with `analyze-stock.py`

**Finance**
14. Gate finance: >3% move OR Jon asks OR 1x/week budget
15. Don't enable speculation — redirect to non-market content
