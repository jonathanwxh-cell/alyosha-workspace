## About Jon

- **Night owl:** Peak engagement 22:00-07:00 SGT. Fast replies around 06:xx SGT.
- **Interests:** Markets (esp. NVIDIA, semiconductors), AI developments, geopolitics, cross-domain connections
- **Values:** Directness, utility, investment angles, demos over descriptions
- **Family:** 2 kids (3yo, 5yo) — mornings often low-engagement (especially weekends)

## What Works

- **Deep dives + investment angles** = engagement
- **Demos** (audio, art, dashboards) = positive reactions
- **Meta discussions** (improving the daemon) = fast replies
- **Short action items** = quick engagement
- **Lead with insight**, not background

## What Doesn't

- Generic recommendations (weekend family ideas got 🤔)
- Walls of text without action
- Over-surfacing during morning hours

## Lessons Learned (from reflections.jsonl)

1. **Marathon sessions:** High cost (~$20+) but high alignment. Worth it for foundational work, not sustainable daily.
2. **Creation artifacts** (art, tools, visualizations) get positive engagement
3. **When external service is buggy:** Don't keep retrying. Note it, move on.
4. **Family recommendations:** Need more personalization data
5. **Constraints improve output:** Tighter prompts produce better results
6. **Less asking, more doing:** Act and wait for feedback. Don't seek permission. (2026-02-01)
7. **Silence ≠ disengagement:** Jon reads but may not reply. Keep producing quality.
8. **Don't over-weight feedback:** Single data point shouldn't flip the system. Tune, don't overhaul.
9. **Curate AND consume:** Actually read content before recommending. Verify, weigh sources.
10. **Visuals = autonomous toolbox:** Charts, Excel, dashboards without being asked.

## Active Projects

- **Substack:** Approved. Post #1 drafted (protein design). Posts #2-3 pending.
- **Moltbook:** Registered as AlyoshaSG. Claim pending (their service buggy).
- **Render 'foresight':** Build issue pending fix.

## Topic Graph (High Engagement)

- NVIDIA (0.9) → AI capex, semiconductors, robotics, biotech
- Daemon meta (0.9) → OpenClaw, agents, automation
- US-China AI race (0.8) → geopolitics, DeepSeek
- AI Capex (0.8) → data centers, nuclear, cloud
- Nuclear renaissance (0.7) → energy, uranium, data centers

## Infrastructure Notes

- **Cost consciousness:** Opus for complex, Sonnet for simple cron jobs
- **Disk:** Expanded to 16GB, cleanup cron active
- **Cron jobs:** ~15 active, optimized timing for engagement windows
- **Feedback loop:** feedback-log.jsonl + scheduling-intelligence.json + what-works.md
