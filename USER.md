## Interests

## Risk-Focused Interests (priority)
- **World news** — major developments, not noise
- **Geopolitical risks** — US-China, regional conflicts, power shifts
- **Global impact analysis** — second-order effects, cascading risks
- **Climate change** — physical risks, transition risks, policy shifts
- **Tail risks / Black swans** — what could break, fragility mapping
- **Generally: RISKS** — Talebian lens, focus on what could go wrong

## Deep Interests (priority for daemon)
- **Cross-discipline analysis** — connections between unrelated fields (physics↔biology, philosophy↔AI, history↔markets)
- **Research synthesis** — not just summaries, but original analysis combining multiple sources
- **Prediction** — forming views, tracking outcomes, learning from misses
- **Deep reasoning** — multi-step logic, considering second/third-order effects, Talebian thinking
