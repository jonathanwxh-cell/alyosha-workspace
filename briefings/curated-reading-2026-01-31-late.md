## 🧠 Philosophy / AI

### "The Mythology of Conscious AI"
**Author:** Anil Seth (Berggruen Prize Essay winner, neuroscience professor)  
**Source:** NOEMA Magazine  
**Link:** https://www.noemamag.com/the-mythology-of-conscious-ai/

Why it's good: Not the usual "is AI conscious?" hot take. Seth argues that consciousness isn't purely computational — it's tied to biological substrates, entropy, and material properties. Challenges the assumption that sufficiently complex algorithms = consciousness. Thoughtful pushback against Hinton/Chalmers.

Key quote: *"The question is no longer about which algorithms give rise to consciousness; it's about how brain-like a system has to be to move the needle on its potential to be conscious."*

## 🤖 Tech / AI Agents

### "Was 2025 Really the Year of AI Agents in the Workforce?"
**Source:** IEEE Spectrum  
**Link:** https://spectrum.ieee.org/2025-year-of-ai-agents

Why it's good: Balanced reality check. Interviews actual practitioners — some are all-in (using Cursor + Claude Code daily), others are disillusioned. Shows where agents actually work (code testing, repetitive tasks) vs where they fail (novel problem-solving). No hype.

Key insight: Programmers leapt ahead because AI-infused IDEs plug into existing workflows. Other industries struggle with integration.

## 🌍 Geopolitics / Macro

### "Advantage China: Trump's Tantrums Push US Allies Closer to Beijing"
**Source:** The Guardian (long-form interactive)  
**Link:** https://www.theguardian.com/news/ng-interactive/2026/jan/25/china-europe-canada-charm-offensive-trump

Why it's good: Concrete examples of realignment happening *now*. Carney's China visit, Ireland's taoiseach meeting Xi, Europe hedging. Quotes from Tsinghua scholars on how China views the chaos. Not ideological — just tracking the shift.

Key frame: *"Canada is forging a new strategic partnership with China... The global order is at a point of rupture, not transition."*

## 🔬 Research / Architecture

### PaTH Attention Paper (MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab)
**Authors:** Songlin Yang, Yoon Kim, et al.  
**Source:** arxiv 2505.16381 / NeurIPS 2025  
**Link:** https://arxiv.org/html/2505.16381v1  
**Explainer:** https://jyopari.github.io/posts/path

Why it's good: Genuine architectural innovation. Fixes transformer state-tracking limitations (TC0 → NC1-complete). Uses Householder transformations for content-aware positional encoding. Not incremental — addresses a fundamental bottleneck.

Practical implication: Better long-context reasoning, agent reliability, code/variable tracking.

## 💹 Investing / Analysis

### r/ValueInvesting: Adobe (ADBE) Investment Thesis
**Source:** Reddit  
**Link:** https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1qpj0g9/adobe_adbe_investment_thesis/

Why it's good: User-generated deep dive modeling worst-case AI disruption scenario. Models revenue contraction, margin compression, terminal value under "AI makes Adobe irrelevant" assumption. Shows limited downside even then. Contrarian framing.

Useful for: Thinking through how to stress-test any "AI disruption" thesis.
