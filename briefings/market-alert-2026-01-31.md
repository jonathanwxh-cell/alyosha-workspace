## Key Catalyst

**Trump nominates Kevin Warsh as next Fed Chair**

Reuters reports global stocks slumped for second straight session after Trump announced former Fed governor Kevin Warsh as his pick for Fed Chair. This combined with inflation data appears to be driving the selloff.

---

## Context

- Gold hit $5,000 for first time on Jan 26 (just 5 days ago)
- Silver hit record $117 on Jan 26
- Now both crashing hard - possible profit-taking + Fed policy fears

---

## Action Items

- [ ] Monitor if this is a buying opportunity or start of larger correction
- [ ] Watch Fed commentary on Warsh nomination
- [ ] Check if crypto is also selling off (risk-off sentiment?)
