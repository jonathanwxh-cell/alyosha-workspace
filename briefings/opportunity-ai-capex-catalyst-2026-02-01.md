# 🎯 Opportunity: AI Capex Catalyst Calendar
*2026-02-01*

## The Setup

The market just shifted from "AI hype" to "show me the ROI." This week's earnings revealed:

- **Meta:** Crushed it. +10% on proof AI ads work. **CapEx guidance: $115-135B for 2026** — massive NVIDIA tailwind.
- **Microsoft:** -11% despite beating revenue. Azure 39% growth "not enough." Punished for spend without visible returns.
- **Tesla:** Pivoted narrative to robotics. Optimus timeline (late 2026) bought them time.

**Key insight:** Consumer-facing AI (Meta) is monetizing NOW. Enterprise AI (Microsoft) is still "trust us."

## The Catalyst Calendar

| Date | Event | Why It Matters |
|------|-------|----------------|
| **Feb 4** | Alphabet earnings | Will they match Meta's CapEx? AI Search monetization? |
| **Feb 5** | Amazon earnings | AWS AI traction. CapEx guidance critical. |
| **Feb 25** | **NVIDIA Q4 FY26** | The main event. Blackwell demand, data center revenue, FY27 guidance. |

## The Trade Ideas

### 1. Pre-NVIDIA Positioning (Higher Risk)
If Alphabet + Amazon both confirm big CapEx, NVIDIA runs into earnings. Consider adding before Feb 25 if:
- GOOGL CapEx guidance ≥ $50B
- AMZN signals AWS AI acceleration

### 2. Post-Earnings Play (Lower Risk)
Wait for Feb 4-5 clarity. If capex confirms, buy any NVDA dip before Feb 25. Historical pattern: NVIDIA tends to beat and raise.

### 3. The Spread
Long NVDA, hedge with short on laggard hyperscaler if one disappoints (e.g., if MSFT continues to underperform).

## What to Watch Feb 4-5

**Alphabet (Feb 4):**
- AI Overviews monetization (are they cannibalizing search ads or growing pie?)
- Cloud AI revenue growth rate
- CapEx guidance (expecting $40-50B+)

**Amazon (Feb 5):**
- AWS AI revenue (Bedrock, Trainium chips)
- CapEx trajectory
- Any robotics/warehouse AI updates

---

## Risk Factors

1. **DeepSeek effect:** If China's cheaper models undercut need for frontier hardware, capex thesis weakens
2. **ROI scrutiny spreads:** If Amazon/Alphabet also get punished like MSFT, could drag NVDA
3. **Valuation:** NVDA already at ~$3.8T. Expectations are sky-high.
