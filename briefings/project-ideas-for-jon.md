## 🏆 Top Pick: "The Dot Connector" Newsletter

**What:** A weekly Substack that connects non-obvious dots between domains — tech, markets, geopolitics, science. Your unique angle: finance professional who reads arxiv papers and thinks in systems.

**Why you:**
- You already have Substack
- Your natural reading pattern (papers + markets + geopolitics) IS the content
- Finance professionals who can translate AI research into investment implications are rare
- Alyosha can help with research/drafts; you add the professional judgment

**Concrete format:**
- 1 post/week, ~1000 words
- Structure: "Three things that connect this week"
- Example: "What PaTH Attention means for the NVDA thesis" or "China's chip self-sufficiency timeline meets Singapore's Micron bet"

**Time commitment:** 2-3 hours/week (1hr reading you'd do anyway + 1-2hr writing/editing)

**Upside:** 
- Builds audience/reputation in AI+finance intersection
- Forces synthesis (learning accelerator)
- Potential paid tier later ($10/mo × 500 subs = $5K/mo passive)

**First issue idea:** "Why the best AI investment thesis isn't NVIDIA" — contrarian hook, connects world models (LeCun/AMI Labs), memory chips (Micron/SK Hynix), and the coming architecture shift.

## ⚡ Quick Win: Investment Memo Generator

**What:** A simple tool that takes a ticker and produces a structured 1-page investment memo using your preferred format + data from Benzinga/Danelfin.

**Why you:**
- You have the API accounts already (Benzinga, Danelfin)
- You know what a good investment memo looks like
- Directly useful for your actual work

**Tech stack:**
- Python script or simple web app
- Pulls: price data, analyst ratings (Danelfin), news sentiment (Benzinga)
- Outputs: Markdown memo with your template (thesis, catalysts, risks, valuation)

**Time commitment:** One weekend to build v1 (Alyosha can write most of the code)

**Upside:**
- Immediate work utility
- Could become a small SaaS if polished ($20/mo for other investors)
- Portfolio piece showing AI+finance integration

## 🔬 Ambitious: "Paper to Alpha" Research Service

**What:** A paid service that takes academic AI/ML papers and translates them into investment implications. Monthly report for subscribers.

**Why you:**
- Massive gap in market: researchers can't invest, investors can't read papers
- You bridge both worlds
- Today's arxiv paper = tomorrow's earnings surprise

**Format:**
- 4 papers/month, deep analysis
- Each paper: What it does → Who benefits → Timeline to commercialization → Tradeable names
- Example: "Attention mechanism improvements" → inference cost reduction → AMD/NVDA margin implications

**Time commitment:** 4-6 hours/month (1-1.5hr per paper)

**Upside:**
- High-value niche (institutional investors would pay $100+/mo)
- Builds genuine expertise
- Creates network effects (researchers notice, companies reach out)

**Risk:** Requires sustained commitment; harder to start than newsletter

## My Recommendation

**Start with the newsletter.** Here's why:

1. **Lowest activation energy** — Substack is ready, content is your natural reading pattern
2. **Compounds** — Each issue builds audience and forces synthesis
3. **Reversible** — Easy to stop if it doesn't work
4. **Alyosha-friendly** — I can help research, draft, find connections
5. **Night owl compatible** — Write after kids sleep

The memo generator is a good weekend project when you want to code. Paper to Alpha is the endgame if the newsletter takes off.

## If You Want to Start This Week

1. Pick a name (or use "The Dot Connector")
2. Write a 500-word "Issue 0" — who you are, what this is, why you're writing
3. Publish it (private or public, your call)
4. Tell me a theme for Issue 1 — I'll research and draft

You write the judgment. I write the legwork.
