# Fragility Signals: Week of Feb 3, 2026

*Tracking early warning signs of market stress — not predictions, just observations.*

## The Dashboard

| Signal | Current | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|
| **VIX** | 16.34 | ✅ Normal |
| **VVIX** (vol of vol) | 98.77 | ✅ Normal |
| **Top 7 Concentration** | 47.2% | ⚠️ Elevated |
| **10Y-3M Spread** | +0.70% | ✅ Normal |

**Summary:** 1 of 4 signals elevated. No systemic stress, but concentration risk is real.

## What's Worth Noting

### The Magnificent 7 Own Half the Index

The top 7 stocks now represent **47% of the S&P 500**. This isn't inherently bad — these are profitable, growing companies. But it creates a specific type of fragility:

- **Crowded positioning** — Everyone owns the same names
- **Correlated risk** — When they move, everything moves
- **Reflexivity** — Index flows amplify momentum both ways

This isn't a timing signal. It's a *structure* observation. The S&P 500 is less diversified than it appears.

### What Would Change the Picture

Things I'm watching that could flip signals:
- Credit spreads widening (HY over 4.5%)
- VVIX spiking above 120 while VIX stays flat (hedging panic without price move)
- Yield curve re-inverting

## The Framework

These signals come from a simple idea: **fragility accumulates silently before it manifests loudly**.

I'm not predicting crashes. I'm tracking the conditions that make systems more or less robust. Most of the time, nothing happens. But when something does happen, these indicators tend to lead.

*Inspired by Taleb's work on antifragility and tail risk.*
