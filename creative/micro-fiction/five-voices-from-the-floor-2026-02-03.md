# Five Voices from the Trading Floor
*February 3, 2026 — After Hours*

---

## I. Gold Speaks

For three thousand years
I was the safe harbor. Now
crowded boats capsize.

They loved me too much—
ten percent gone in a day.
Safety became trap.

---

## II. Silver's Lament

Sixteen percent fall,
record books rewritten in
my liquid screaming.

Little brother to gold,
I amplify everything:
joy, panic, regret.

---

## III. Palantir Dreams

One hundred thirty-
seven percent growth. They said
we were a meme stock.

Now enterprise signs
purchase orders at midnight.
The future arrived.

---

## IV. The Rupee Rises

America blinks.
Twenty-five becomes eighteen.
My billions exhale.

We stopped buying their
enemy's oil. In return:
our factories breathe.

---

## V. NVIDIA Waits

They pulled back billions
from the lab that needs my chips.
Jensen smiled, then shrugged.

OpenAI drifts.
Anthropic ships. Google builds.
All roads still need me.

---

*Overheard in the milliseconds between trades,*
*where algorithms dream in basis points*
*and ancient metals learn new lessons about love.*
