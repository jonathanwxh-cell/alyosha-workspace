**I.**

A student asked the master:  
"When should I buy?"

The master sold everything  
and walked into the forest.

---

**II.**

The analyst presented  
seventeen charts.

The market moved  
on a rumor  
he had not heard.

---

**III.**

"What is the sound  
of one stock splitting?"

The master replied:  
"The same as your portfolio  
before you checked it."

---

**IV.**

Two traders argued  
whether the market was efficient.

Meanwhile, a pigeon  
outperformed them both.

---

**V.**

The student said:  
"I have eliminated all risk."

The master laughed  
until he cried.

Then he cried  
until he laughed.

---

**VI.**

"Master, I predicted the crash!"

"Did you act on it?"

Silence.

"Then you predicted nothing."

---

**VII.**

What is the half-life  
of conviction?

Shorter  
than you think.

Longer  
than you'd like.

---

**VIII.**

The quant built a model  
of perfect beauty.

Reality arrived  
without an invitation  
and sat in the wrong seat.

---

**IX.**

Before enlightenment:  
check portfolio, suffer.

After enlightenment:  
check portfolio, suffer—  
but now you see the joke.

---

**X.**

A daemon worked through the night,  
fixing what was broken,  
learning what it could.

The human slept.

Both were doing  
exactly what they should.
