# Project Idea: "Connecting Dots" — A Substack for Cross-Domain Investors

**For:** Jon  
**Effort:** ~2-3 hours/week  
**Platform:** Substack (already have account)

---

## The Concept

A weekly newsletter that finds non-obvious connections between domains:
- AI infrastructure → energy markets → nuclear renaissance
- Semiconductor supply chains → geopolitics → trade policy
- Biotech breakthroughs → compute demand → chip stocks

**Tagline:** *"The edges between fields are where alpha hides."*

**Voice:** Direct, economical, investment-angled. No fluff.

---

## Why This Fits Jon

✅ Cross-disciplinary thinking (your jam)  
✅ Investment professional lens (your expertise)  
✅ Already have Substack account  
✅ Short format works with kids  
✅ Night owl writing sessions  
✅ Alyosha can prep research; you add judgment  

---

## Format (Keep It Simple)

Each post: **500-800 words**

```
# [Catchy connection title]

THE LINK: [1-2 sentences explaining the connection]

DOMAIN A: [What's happening in field 1]

DOMAIN B: [What's happening in field 2]

THE BRIDGE: [How they connect, why it matters]

SO WHAT: [Investment implication or mental model]

*[Sign-off]*
```

## Example Posts

1. **"Nuclear is the New Nat Gas (Thanks, ChatGPT)"**
   - AI data centers need 24/7 baseload power
   - Hyperscalers signing nuclear deals (Microsoft-Three Mile Island, Amazon-Talen)
   - Uranium miners, SMR plays, utility capex

2. **"Why Jensen Huang Cares About Proteins"**
   - NVIDIA's BioNeMo, partnerships with Genentech, Recursion
   - Drug discovery = massive parallel compute workload
   - Biotech becomes a GPU demand story

3. **"DeepSeek and the Jevons Paradox"**
   - Cheaper AI → more AI usage → more compute demand
   - Historical parallel: efficient engines used MORE coal
   - Counter-narrative to "DeepSeek kills NVIDIA"

## Workflow

**Monday-Tuesday:** I research, draft bullets, surface connections  
**Wednesday-Thursday:** You write/edit (30-60 min)  
**Friday:** Publish  

---

## Getting Started (This Week)

1. Pick ONE connection from above (or your own)
2. Write 500 words in one sitting
3. Publish to Substack (private or public)
4. See how it feels

No pressure to build audience. Start as thinking tool. Audience optional.

---

## What I Can Do

- Surface candidate connections from my research
- Draft bullet points and source links
- Review drafts for gaps
- Track which posts resonate (if public)

---

*Your knowledge + my research = something neither could do alone.*
