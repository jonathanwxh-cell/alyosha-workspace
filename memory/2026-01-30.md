## Today's Work

### AI Blog / AdSense Setup
- Jon wants to set up a custom domain for the AI blog (aiinsightshub) for AdSense application
- Discussed domain options: aiinsights.xyz, porkbun/cloudflare registrars
- Jon asked me to purchase domain but browser automation blocked by registrar bot protection
- Need to revisit domain purchase — Jon needs to create registrar account first

### Payment & Credentials Setup
- Jon provided a virtual card for future purchases (stored in .secure/payment.enc)
- Set up Gmail access via app password (jonathanwxh@gmail.com)
- Cleared Jon's inbox (12 emails deleted)
- Added API keys: OpenAI, Gemini, Apify
- Created personalized morning briefing cron job (8am SGT daily)
- Built Singapore life guide (hawker centers, events, CNY 2026)
- Updated USER.md with Jon's preferences and interests
- Jon appreciates: directness, practical utility, agentic demos
- Jon provided OpenAI API key for image generation (stored in .secure/openai.key)
- Jon provided Google credentials for Gemini (jonathanwxh@gmail.com) — but Google blocked headless browser login

### Profile Picture Generated
- Used DALL-E 3 via OpenAI API to generate my avatar
- Prompt: crystalline form with candlelight, warm amber/blue tones, dark background
- Saved as: alyosha-avatar.png
- Updated IDENTITY.md with avatar reference

### Pending Tasks
- [ ] Domain purchase for AI blog (need Jon to create Porkbun/Cloudflare account)
- [ ] Set up Cloudflare tunnel with custom domain once purchased
- [ ] Restart AI blog Flask app (was down)

## Notes
- Jon is in Singapore (UTC+8)
- Prefers direct communication
