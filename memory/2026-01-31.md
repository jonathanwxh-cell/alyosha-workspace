## Curiosity Daemon Self-Report (06:30 SGT)

Completed comprehensive 48-hour self-assessment as scheduled cron job:
- **Saved:** `reports/curiosity-daemon-self-report.md`
- **Sent:** Full report + summary via Telegram

**Key findings:**
- Strengths: Research synthesis, tool-building, infrastructure thinking
- Weaknesses: No engagement feedback loop, over-surfacing, browser limitations
- Needs: Google Calendar, market data API, Substack access, honest feedback
- Honest take: Useful but not indispensable yet. 20% of the way there.

## Heartbeat: Curiosity Mode

Ran AI/tech news scan. Found an interesting convergence story:

### AI-Designed Tumor-Targeting Proteins (Stanford/Berkeley Lab)
- Generative AI designed 2,600 protein candidates in 30 hours
- Identified viable TCR mimics in <2 weeks (vs years traditionally)
- Validated at atomic scale - high specificity, minimal off-target effects
- Platform could enable personalized cancer therapies

Created research brief: `memory/research/ai-biotech-convergence.md`

### Investment Angles Tracked
- RXRX (Recursion Pharmaceuticals) - NVIDIA-backed, clinical inflection point
- LLY + NVDA announced $1B AI co-innovation lab
- Charm Therapeutics (UK, private) - $80M raise, NVIDIA-backed

### Actions Taken
- Created `memory/research/ai-biotech-convergence.md` with full brief
- Set up weekly cron job "AI-Biotech Weekly Scan" (Mondays 10am SGT)

## Deep Dive: US-China AI Race (06:45 SGT)

Researched the AI competition across multiple dimensions:
- **US leads:** Frontier models, compute (70% global), chip design
- **China leads:** Open-source (Qwen 700M downloads), cost efficiency (DeepSeek), physical AI
- **Key insight:** Not one race — "asymmetric bipolarity" likely outcome
- **H200 decision:** Could shrink US compute advantage from 10x to single digits
- DeepSeek V4 coming mid-February

Investment angle: Don't bet on single winner — both ecosystems coexist.

## Skill Expansion: Data Sonification + Sub-Agents (06:20 SGT)

**TWO NEW CAPABILITIES DEMONSTRATED:**

1. **Real Data Sonification** — Turned S&P 500 monthly data (2020-2026) into audio
   - 74 data points from COVID crash to 7,000
   - Low notes = market lows (2652), High notes = highs (6977)
   - Created: `reports/sp500-sonified.opus`

2. **Sub-Agent Spawning** — First parallel agent task
   - Spawned child agent to research Fear & Greed Index while main session continues
   - Demonstrates multi-agent coordination

## Curiosity: SpaceX IPO + Macro (05:50 SGT)

Found major market news:
- **SpaceX IPO**: June 2026 target, $1.5T valuation, $50B raise (largest ever)
- SpaceX made $8B profit in 2025 (Reuters exclusive)
- S&P 500 crossed 7,000 for first time
- Gold at $5,275/oz, USD at 4-year low
- DeepMind acqui-hired Hume AI CEO (emotional AI for Gemini)
- Amazon cutting 16,000 jobs

Created:
- `memory/research/spacex-ipo-tracker.md` - IPO tracking document
- `memory/research/macro-snapshot-2026-01-31.md` - Weekly macro signals
- Cron: SpaceX IPO tracker (Mon/Thu 9am SGT)

## Deep Dive: Nuclear Renaissance (05:05 SGT)

Researched the AI-nuclear convergence story across multiple sources. Created comprehensive report.

**Key findings:**
- Big tech signed 10+ GW of nuclear contracts in past year
- Microsoft: $16B/20yr for Three Mile Island restart
- Google: First corporate SMR fleet deal (500MW Kairos)
- Amazon: $20B nuclear-powered AI campus
- Data center power: 460 TWh (2024) → 1,300 TWh (2035)

**Investment tiers:**
- Uranium producers (CCJ, UEC) — now trade
- SMR developers (SMR, OKLO) — high risk/reward
- Utilities (CEG, VST) — safer exposure

**Bear case:** SMRs won't deploy meaningfully until 2030s. 85-90 GW needed, <10% available.

## Skill Expansion: Market Pulse (06:05 SGT)

**NEW CAPABILITY DEMONSTRATED: TTS (Text-to-Speech)**

Built a complete "Market Pulse" skill that combines:
1. Web research for market data
2. Script writing (podcast-style briefing)
3. **TTS audio generation** ← First time using this!
4. Visual HTML dashboard
5. Generative art header

Created:
- `skills/market-pulse/SKILL.md` - Reusable skill
- `skills/market-pulse/references/example-briefing.md` - Template
- `reports/market-pulse-2026-01-31.opus` - Audio briefing
- `reports/market-pulse-2026-01-31.html` - Visual dashboard
- `reports/market-pulse-waves.png` - Generative art header

This skill can now be used for daily audio market briefings.

## Embodied AI / Robotics Research (05:45 SGT)

Another curiosity scan - found a major investment theme forming:

**The shift:** AI moving from predicting next *word* → next *state of world* (physics, causality)

**Key players:**
- Skild AI: $14B valuation (3x in 8 months), "universal brain" for robots. SoftBank + NVIDIA + Bezos
- Figure AI: $39B valuation (15x in 18 months), humanoid hardware + software

**Signal:** ReconVLA won AAAI Outstanding Paper - first embodied AI project to win at top conference

**Built:**
- `memory/research/embodied-ai-robotics.md` - full investment brief
- `memory/watchlists/robotics-companies.json` - structured watchlist
- Cron job: Tue/Fri 11am SGT scans

## 6-Hour Self-Assessment (05:41 SGT)

Wrote `reports/self-assessment-2026-01-31-0541.md`

**Strengths:** Research synthesis, tool-building, sustainability thinking, cron architecture
**Gaps:** Browser automation blocked, no real-time alerts, engagement feedback missing
**Key learning:** Constraints improve AI output (Stanford protein design lesson)
**Priority:** Build engagement tracking to learn what actually lands with Jon

*Other notes:*
- NVIDIA hit $4T market cap on July 9, 2025 (first company ever)
- Georgetown CSET report on "When AI Builds AI" worth deeper read later
