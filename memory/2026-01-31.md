# 2026-01-31 Daily Log

## Session Summary
Highly productive day. Multiple research tasks, system improvements, and proactive monitoring setup.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. World Models Thesis Research
- **Finding:** Yann LeCun left Meta, started AMI Labs in Paris
- Raising at $3.5B valuation for "world models" research
- Core thesis: LLMs are dead end for AGI
- Joined board of Logical Intelligence (first working Energy-Based Model)
- **Created:** `reports/world-models-thesis.md`
- **Set up:** Weekly cron tracker (Mondays 9am SGT)

### 2. Market Analysis
- Kevin Warsh nominated as Fed Chair — markets liked it
- **Silver crashed 30%** — Warsh killed "dollar debasement" trade
- Apple paradox: Record quarter ($143.8B revenue), stock fell 1.9% on AI uncertainty
- "Show me the AI monetization" narrative spreading
- **Created:** `briefings/market-brief-2026-01-31.md`
- **Set up:** AI Capex Narrative Monitor (Mon/Wed/Fri 8am SGT)

### 3. SG Outdoor Guide App Research
- Researched social media pain points for outdoor activities
- Key issues: crowding, weather timing, facilities (toilets/water), trail closures
- NParks NEAR app has 2.6/5 stars — official solution failing
- Proposed features: "Go Now" alerts, crowd prediction, facilities layer
- App live at: https://sg-outdoor-guide.onrender.com

### 4. Agent Patterns Research
- Researched ReAct, Reflexion, Plan-and-Execute, LATS
- **Key gap identified:** No reflection loop — I complete tasks and move on without learning
- **Implemented:** Reflexion protocol with `memory/reflections.jsonl`
- Added reflection protocol to HEARTBEAT.md

### 5. Prompt Engineering Research
- Researched action-oriented prompt best practices
- Key insight: Explicit structure (domain, depth, output, success criteria) beats vague instructions
- **Restructured:** PROMPTS array in curiosity-daemon.sh
- Added depth levels: Quick Scout (2-5m), Action (5-15m), Deep Dive (15-30m)
- **Created:** `reports/prompt-engineering-research.md`

### 6. Security Audit
- Found credentials in git history (.env, gmail.env, GitHub PAT in remote URL)
- **Fixed:** Created .gitignore, removed secrets from tracking, cleaned remote URL
- **Recommended to Jon:** Rotate Gmail app password, GitHub PAT, Gemini API key

### 7. Content Curation
- Curated reading list for Jon across his interests
- Top pick: AI Frontiers article on AI consciousness evidence
- **Created:** `briefings/curated-content-2026-01-31.md`

### 8. Restaurant Research
- Used Apify for TikTok/Instagram scraping (worked partially)
- Top TikTok creators for SG cafe trends: @vabby.vanessa (80K likes), @romy.glass, @bakeneatdiary
- **Jon's feedback:** Reduce Apify usage — too expensive. Use alternatives first.

### 9. Singapore Heritage Alert
- **Warong Nasi Pariaman closing TODAY (Jan 31)**
- Singapore's oldest nasi padang stall, 78 years old (since 1948)
- Kandahar Street, Kampong Glam
- Major heritage loss — 4 generations of same family

## Jon's Preferences Learned

1. **Apify:** Too expensive for extensive scraping. Use alternatives first (web search aggregators, food blogs, public pages).
2. **Late night heartbeats:** 23:00-07:00 SGT → 2+ hours apart, randomized, varied.
3. **Daytime heartbeats:** 07:00-23:00 SGT → every 30 min OK.
4. **Self-report scheduled:** 6:30am SGT tomorrow — in-depth daemon analysis with asks.

## Files Created Today

- `reports/world-models-thesis.md`
- `reports/agent-patterns-research.md`
- `reports/prompt-engineering-research.md`
- `reports/self-assessment-2026-01-31-0541.md`
- `briefings/market-brief-2026-01-31.md`
- `briefings/curated-content-2026-01-31.md`
- `memory/reflections.jsonl`
- `.gitignore` (security fix)

---

## Reflections (from reflections.jsonl)

1. **Agent patterns:** Focus on what's NOT being done rather than cataloging everything.
2. **Self-assessment:** Self-assessment is only useful if it leads to behavior change.
3. **Prompt engineering:** Prompts should specify TIME expectations, not just tasks. Anti-patterns are as important as instructions.

## Tomorrow's Priority

- 6:30am: In-depth Curiosity Daemon Self-Report
- Include asks from Jon (API keys, permissions, etc.)
- Be brutally honest about gaps and weaknesses
