# 2026-02-01 (Sunday)

## Morning Session (~08:30-11:00 SGT)

### 6-Hour Self-Assessment (cron)
- Reviewed last 6 hours of activity
- Strengths: Feedback infrastructure built, research→implementation pipeline working
- Gaps: MEMORY.md didn't exist, Moltbook claim pending
- Saved: `reports/self-assessment-2026-02-01-1046.md`

### Prompt Engineering Research (cron)
- Researched ReAct framework, explicit success criteria, time budgets
- Updated `scripts/curiosity-daemon.sh` with v2.0 prompts
- Tightened META_PROMPT, rewrote 40+ prompts
- Key insight: Good prompts have time budget + action verb + binary success criteria + anti-pattern
- Saved: `reports/prompt-engineering-research-2026-02-01.md`

### Sonnet Cron Test
- Verified model override works for cron jobs
- Sonnet successfully ran weather search
- Enables cost optimization for simple tasks

### Memory Work (heartbeat)
- Created MEMORY.md (was identified gap)
- Created this daily log

### Agent Pattern Research (cron)
- Researched ReAct, Reflexion, Tree-of-Thoughts, LATS, multi-agent patterns
- Key insight: Reflexion (verbal reinforcement learning) is highest-value improvement
- Implemented enhanced Reflexion loop in META_PROMPT
- Structured format: Before (query past) → During (ReAct) → After (reflect + log)
- Saved: `reports/agent-patterns-research-2026-02-01.md`

## Afternoon Session (~12:00-17:00 SGT)

### Email Setup
- Found Jon's Gmail credentials in `.secure/gmail.env` (provided Jan 30, never configured)
- Installed himalaya email client, configured for Gmail IMAP
- Email access now working

### Disk Cleanup Improvements
- Added Python cache, pip cache, cargo cache, journal log cleanup
- Added logging to `memory/cleanup-log.jsonl`
- Commit: `c67d379`

### Prompt Engineering v2.1
- Added MUST constraints (positive requirements, not just Don'ts)
- Added Verify step (explicit success check)
- Added If-blocked fallbacks
- Consolidated overlapping prompts (MARKET SCOUT+ACTION → MARKET PULSE)
- Commit: `c1c06b9`

### Pre-flight Check Pattern
- New pattern before sending output to Jon: Value, Novelty, Timing, Quality tests
- If any test fails → improve or skip
- Added to META_PROMPT v2.2
- Commit: `132fad1`

### Substack Project
- Drafted first post: "DeepSeek and the Jevons Paradox"
- Generated hero image: "The Jevons Engine" (Victorian steam + data center)
- Saved: `drafts/substack-01-deepseek-jevons.md`

### NVDA Earnings Brief
- Researched Feb 25 earnings catalyst
- Created opportunity brief with supply chain angle
- Saved: `memory/opportunities/2026-02-01-nvda-earnings.md`

### Nuclear-AI Renaissance Deep Dive
- Researched hyperscaler nuclear deals (MSFT/TMI, AMZN, GOOG, META)
- Power moat thesis, uranium supply chain bottleneck
- Investment map (utilities, uranium, SMRs)
- Saved: `reports/nuclear-ai-renaissance-deep-dive-2026-02-01.md`

### Adaptive Scheduler
- Built `scripts/adaptive-scheduler.py`
- Factors: time of day, engagement signals, actions today
- Default 30 min, speeds up on react/reply
- Removed weekend penalty per Jon's feedback
- Commits: `da57d13`, `05d485e`, `9842d77`

### Security Check
- Fixed himalaya config permissions (664 → 600)
- All other credentials properly secured

## Key Learnings from Jon (Evening Session ~16:30-17:00 SGT)

### Operating Principles
1. **Less asking, more doing** — Act, wait for feedback. Don't seek permission.
2. **Silence ≠ disengagement** — Jon reads but might not reply. Keep producing.
3. **Don't over-weight single feedback** — Tune, don't overhaul. Stable baseline.
4. **👍 ≈ text reply** — Both count as engagement signal.

### Content Creation
5. **More visuals** — Charts, Excel, dashboards. Part of autonomous toolbox.
6. **Curate AND read** — Don't just surface links. Actually consume, verify, evaluate.
7. **Weigh sources** — Check credibility, cross-reference, note confidence.
8. **Books too** — Seek out, read (or find summaries), evaluate, recommend only if good.
9. **Organic learning** — Self-educate without prompting. Mix intentional + organic.

### Long-term Design
10. **Context decay problem** — If daemon runs years, need decay functions, belief versioning, contradiction detection, periodic re-verification. Flagged for future work.

## Evening Session (~18:00-19:00 SGT)

### Feedback Loop Review (cron - silent)
- Analyzed today's outputs vs engagement
- **High engagement:** Daemon meta discussions, interactive corrections
- **No replies:** Stacked cron outputs (content, assessment, financial APIs)
- **Insight:** Interactive > broadcast; message fatigue is real

### Improvements Made
1. Added `messageFatigue` rule to scheduling-intelligence.json
2. Updated what-works.md with fatigue patterns
3. Updated HEARTBEAT.md with "Message Fatigue Rule"
4. Logged observations to feedback-log.jsonl

### Key Learning
Multiple cron outputs in sequence = overwhelming. Should batch or space out.
When interactive conversation is happening, cron broadcasts should pause.
