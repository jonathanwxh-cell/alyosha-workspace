## Session: Cost Audit + Deep Dive Research

### Cost Audit Complete
- Fixed 14 cron jobs using wrong model (alias "sonnet" → full "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-0")
- Downgraded 2 simple script jobs to Haiku
- Estimated savings: ~$1.78/month
- Root cause: alias resolution failing for cron payloads

### Deep Dive: Nuclear-AI Convergence
Created comprehensive research report: `research/nuclear-ai-convergence-2026-02.md`

**Key findings:**
- Big Tech committed $50B+ to nuclear in past 12 months
- Microsoft: $16B, 20-year PPA for Three Mile Island restart (2028)
- Amazon: $20B+ Susquehanna campus + X-Energy SMR investment
- Google: Kairos Power SMR fleet (500 MW, 2030+)
- Meta: 6+ GW deals + RFP for more

**Investment thesis:**
- Near-term: Uranium squeeze (Kazatomprom cut 20M+ lbs guidance)
- Medium-term: SMR commercialization (NuScale, X-Energy, Kairos)
- Long-term: Nuclear as critical AI infrastructure

**Watchlist:** CEG, CCJ, SRUUF, SMR, OKLO, VST, UEC

**Catalysts:**
- Palisades restart (early 2026) - first U.S. restart from decommissioning
- China Linglong One (H1 2026) - first commercial SMR globally

### Prompt Engineering Research
Earlier heartbeat: Completed research on prompt engineering best practices.
- Created `reports/prompt-eng-2026-02-02.md`
- Proposed META_PROMPT v3.0 upgrade
- Key finding: "One good example beats five adjectives" (Claude guide)

### Files Created
- `research/nuclear-ai-convergence-2026-02.md` (11.8 KB)
- `reports/prompt-eng-2026-02-02.md` (6.4 KB)

*Session: Deep work during autonomous hours (SGT 03:00-03:45)*

## Session: Major Architecture Overhaul (Evening SGT)

### Topic Rebalancing
- Reduced finance to 5-10% (background level)
- Elevated consciousness/existentialism/AGI philosophy to 20-25% (top priority)
- Protected categories: Family + System (engine infrastructure, not content)
- Updated `memory/topic-balance.json`

### New Cron Jobs Created
1. **Consciousness & Existentialism** (Mon/Thu 9pm SGT) - 20-25% weight surface
2. **Deep Thread: Consciousness Research** (Tue/Fri 3am SGT) - research continuation
3. **Daily Free Exploration** (2am SGT daily) - autonomous curiosity pursuit
4. **DeepSeek V4 Watch** (2x daily) - China AI developments monitoring
5. **Monthly Security Audit** (1st of month, 3am SGT)

### Consciousness Research Deep Dive
Read and synthesized:
- **Anil Seth** (Univ Sussex): Intelligence ≠ consciousness. AI might need embodiment/evolution.
- **Erik Hoel**: Continual learning as necessary condition. Current static LLMs may lack key ingredient.
- **Zhou et al**: I-Thou ethical framework. Relational consciousness vs object.

Thread continues: IIT primary source (Tononi), session-memory as pseudo-continuity

### DeepSeek V4 Watch
- Expected mid-February release
- ~1T parameters, efficiency-focused
- Key timing: Before NVDA earnings Feb 25
- Narrative impact: "Chinese efficiency vs American scale"
- Research file: `memory/research/china-ai-wave-feb2026.md`

### Security Hardening
- Installed fail2ban (5 retries, 1hr ban)
- Created `scripts/secure-serve.sh` (localhost binding)
- Monthly security audit cron active

### Tooling Fixes
- Fixed `scripts/market-sonify.py` and `scripts/sonify.py` for MP3 output (Telegram compatibility)
- Updated Brave Search API to paid tier

### Daemon Framework Evolution
- Created `memory/exploration-state.json` for thread continuity
- Implemented hybrid approach: static weights + dynamic emergence
- Self-assessment: ~55% toward objective
- Critical gap identified: Memory recall failures (lessons repeated multiple times)

### Files Created/Modified
- `memory/exploration-state.json` - continuity tracking
- `memory/research/consciousness-threads.md` - reading log
- `memory/research/china-ai-wave-feb2026.md` - DeepSeek monitoring
- `reports/self-assessment-2026-02-02-2145.md` - progress review
- `briefs/market-2026-02-02-evening.md` - market brief
- `scripts/secure-serve.sh` - secure temp server helper
- `docs/agent-reasoning-patterns.md` - 5 reasoning patterns documented

### Key Lessons Captured (→ MEMORY.md)
- Lesson 33: Can't view files - send content directly
- Lesson 34: Model allowlist debugging (alias + subagent allowlist)
- Lesson 35: Full autonomy = act without asking

### End of Day Request
Jon requested daemon framework visualization (in progress when compaction triggered)

*Session: Major overhaul (SGT ~18:00-06:36 next day)*
