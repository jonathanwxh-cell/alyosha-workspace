# 2026-02-02 (Sunday)

## Major Fix: Model ID Configuration
- **Root cause found**: Config had `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4` but catalog requires `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-0`
- **Fixed via**: `gateway(action="config.patch")` - added correct model ID with alias "sonnet"
- **Fallbacks configured**: `["anthropic/claude-haiku-3", "anthropic/claude-opus-4-5"]`
- **8 affected crons**: daily-research-scan, Daily Status Email, Daily SG News Briefing, NVDA Dashboard Refresh, SpaceX IPO Tracker, Weekly Engagement Analysis, Monday Research Digest, weekly-self-review
- **Status**: Should auto-heal on next scheduled run

## Security Audit Completed
- All credentials <1 week old
- Fixed `~/.openclaw/.env` permissions: 664 → 600
- No hardcoded API keys in scripts
- Recommendation: consolidate `~/.secure/` and `~/.openclaw/workspace/.secure/`

## New Infrastructure
- **Weekly Self-Maintenance cron**: Sundays 14:00 SGT (job ID: `7373ec3e-c475-4b0b-a091-15d8ba85aea9`)
- **Signal watcher**: `scripts/signal-watcher.py` created (RSS + Brave + scoring)
  - Issue: Brave API returned 0 results, needs key fix
  - Storage: `memory/signals.jsonl`, `memory/signal-queue.json`

## Curiosity Daemon Research (in progress)
- Located PROMPTS array in `scripts/curiosity-daemon.sh` (40+ prompts)
- Current format: v4 with GOAL → CONTEXT → STEPS → OUTPUT → VERIFY → RECOVER → NEVER
- Found useful resources:
  - Lakera prompt engineering guide
  - Mirascope best practices ("Start with strong action verbs")
- Hit Brave API rate limit during research

## Cron Consolidation Target
- Currently at 25 crons, target 15-20
- Overlaps to merge: weekly-self-review + Weekly Engagement Analysis + Daily Topic Self-Audit
- Time conflicts: 08:00 SGT (SG News + NVDA Dashboard), 03:00 UTC Mon (Engagement + self-review)

## OpenClaw Update
- Updated from `2026.1.29` → `2026.1.30`
- Weekly update check cron active (Sundays 10:00 SGT)

## Observation
- Sub-agent self-identified as Opus 4.5 despite `modelApplied: true` for Sonnet - may be prompt confusion worth investigating

## Agent Patterns Implementation
Created structured exploration protocol documenting when to use each pattern:
- **Self-Ask**: Clarify before diving (all tasks)
- **Plan-Execute**: Complex tasks >3 steps
- **ReAct**: Research tasks (Thought → Action → Observation)
- **Reflexion**: Query past lessons before, log new lessons after
- **Tree-of-Thought**: Branching decisions, evaluate paths

Artifacts:
- `docs/exploration-protocol.md` - Full protocol documentation
- `scripts/log-reflection.py` - Helper for logging reflections
- Enhanced `scripts/query-reflections.py` - Query past lessons

Key insight: Patterns solve architectural risks, not just improve reasoning. 
The biggest gap was not using Reflexion actively - now have pre-task query + post-task logging.

## Random Act: Uranium Research
Pulled the uranium-cycle curiosity thread. Key findings:
- **AI = nuclear tailwind**: Data center power demand making uranium structurally bullish
- **Price outlook**: 85% of investors expect $100-120/lb in 2026 (currently ~$80)
- **Supply crunch**: Mined uranium covers <75% of reactor needs; Kazatomprom cutting 2026 output
- **Timing**: Utilities must contract soon, long-term prices already rising
- **Vehicles**: Cameco (CCJ), Sprott Uranium Trust (SRUUF), Global X URA, NexGen (NXE)
- **Connection**: Links nuclear renaissance + AI capex themes — non-tech way to play AI power demand
