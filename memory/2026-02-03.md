## Session: Agent Architecture Research (continued from compaction)

### Research Completed (pre-compaction)
Deep dive into autonomous agent architectures for improving daemon exploration:

**ReAct Pattern (Yao et al., 2022)**
- Interleaves reasoning traces + task-specific actions
- Format: Thought → Action → Observation → repeat
- Benefits: Interpretability, dynamic planning, reduced hallucination
- Paper: arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629

**Tree of Thoughts (ToT) (Yao et al., 2023)**
- Maintains tree of coherent thought sequences
- Uses search algorithms (BFS/DFS) with self-evaluation
- Good for complex problems requiring strategic lookahead
- Paper: arxiv.org/abs/2305.10601

**LATS (Language Agent Tree Search)**
- Combines LM reasoning/acting/planning with Monte Carlo Tree Search
- Uses LLMs as agents, value functions, and optimizers
- State-of-the-art on HotPotQA, WebShop benchmarks
- Paper: arxiv.org/abs/2310.04406 (ICML 2024)

### Decision Pending
Need to select one pattern to implement or document:
- **Reflexion already integrated** into curiosity-engine.py (query past lessons)
- **ReAct** most practical for immediate use (already similar to how I work)
- **ToT** good for research/analysis tasks requiring exploration
- **LATS** most sophisticated but complex to implement

### Architecture Research Doc
Created `docs/daemon-architecture-research.md` with comprehensive findings.

### Key Files Modified
- `scripts/curiosity-engine.py` - Enhanced META_PROMPT with Reflexion
- `scripts/query-reflections.py` - Tool for querying past lessons
- `HEARTBEAT.md` - Added Reflexion Protocol section

## Cost Status
- ~$66/month total ($60 Opus main, $6 Sonnet crons)
- 27 cron jobs all on `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-0`
- Haiku not in subagent allowlist (use Sonnet instead)

## Upcoming
- Singapore Airshow reminder: Feb 6 (family guide ready)
- DeepSeek V4: Expected mid-February
- CNY 2026: Feb 17

## Memory Maintenance (01:12 UTC)

Updated after Jon's reminder to "act before asking":
- MEMORY.md: Added sonification to "What Works", reinforced autonomy lesson with warning
- heartbeat-state.json: Updated last action
- reflections.jsonl: Added sonification lesson
- daily-context.json: Updated to Feb 3 (was stale from Feb 2)
- topic-balance.json: Incremented creative count
- TOOLS.md: Documented new data-to-audio synth capability

All JSON files validated. No corruption found.

## Message Source Documentation (01:20 UTC)

Created `memory/message-sources.md` distinguishing:
- **Cron messages** — scheduled, subject to topic balance targets
- **Non-cron messages** — interactive replies, not subject to balance

Key insight: Finance crons exist independently of topic-balance tracking. The tracking records but doesn't gate.
