# 2026-02-03 — Session Log

## Major Accomplishments

### Infrastructure Built
- **GitHub auto-commit** — Repo: `jonathanwxh-cell/alyosha-workspace`, daily 8pm SGT cron
- **Render auto-deploy** — Blueprint configured, `apps/fragility-dashboard` ready
- **.gitignore** — Excludes secrets, binaries, temp files
- **Git identity** — Set to Alyosha <alyosha@openclaw.ai>

### Tools Created
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `scripts/fragility-tracker.py` | Market stress signals (VIX, VVIX, concentration, curve) |
| `scripts/cost-tracker.py` | Daily API + AWS cost logging to Excel |
| `scripts/research-scan.py` | HackerNews + ArXiv aggregator |
| `scripts/memory-extract.py` | Automated memory extraction from logs |
| `scripts/self-challenge.py` | Generate practice tasks from weaknesses |
| `scripts/reddit-research.py` | Reddit scanner (blocked by IP, ready when API available) |

### Protocols Created
- `protocols/curation-protocol.md` — Mandatory checklist before recommending content
- `protocols/quality-check.md` — Self-scoring before significant outputs

### Crons Added
- Auto-Commit to GitHub (8pm SGT daily)
- Research Scan (8am SGT daily)  
- Fragility Signals Weekly (9am SGT Sundays)
- Daily Cost Log (midnight SGT)
- Nightly Memory Extraction (4am SGT)

### Research Completed
1. **AI Infrastructure Fragility** — Deep dive on TSMC concentration (90%), grid saturation (11x price increase), water crisis, CUDA monoculture
2. **Daemon Improvement** — LangMem, Letta, Reflexion patterns, self-improving agents
3. **Sea Limited (SE)** — Full business analysis using FMP API, transcript tone analysis

## Key Lessons Confirmed

**#37 — PROACTIVE INFRASTRUCTURE:** Don't wait for Jon to notice problems. Fix → Report.

**#38 — DEEP DIVE STANDARD:** Multi-source, actually READ, apply mental models, original analysis, investment implications.

## Fragility Tracker First Reading
| Signal | Value | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| VIX | 16.34 | ✅ Normal |
| VVIX | 98.77 | ✅ Normal |
| Top 7 Concentration | 47.2% | ⚠️ Elevated |
| 10Y-3M Spread | +0.70% | ✅ Normal |

## Sea Limited Key Findings
- Turnaround: -$2B (2021) → +$444M (2024)
- Shopee: 52% SEA market share
- SeaMoney: 70% loan growth (watch NPL)
- Stock: -43% from high, PT $183-194 (+61%)
- Management tone: Confident, no hedging language

## Cost Tracking Started
| Date | Model Fees | AWS | Total |
|------|-----------|-----|-------|
| 2026-02-02 | $11.50 | $1.50 | $13.00 |

## Session Stats
- Git commits: 15+
