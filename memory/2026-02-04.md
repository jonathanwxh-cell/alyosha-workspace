## 23:14 SGT — Feedback Loop Review

**Analyzed:** feedback-log.jsonl, reflections.jsonl, cron runs
**Key patterns:**
- High engagement: SPECIFIC + FRAMEWORK + ACTIONABLE format
- Low value: broadcast content without interaction
- Recurring failure: infrastructure misaligned with config (80% finance infra for 5-10% target)

**Actions taken:**
- Verified cron cleanup complete (14 active, all system/self-improvement)
- Fixed collision: Auto Anti-Pattern Learning moved from 5am → 6am Sunday
- Confirmed weekly-self-review model fix already applied

**Current state:** Clean cron foundation. Ready to build up deliberately.
