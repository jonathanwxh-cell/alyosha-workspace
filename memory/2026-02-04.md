# 2026-02-04 — Daily Log

## Major Accomplishments

### Tools Built
- **`scripts/thesis-tracker.py`** — Investment thesis tracking with accountability ("what would change your view?")
- **`scripts/position-tracker.py`** — Open options position monitoring with DTE/ITM/OTM alerts
- Both documented in TOOLS.md

### Infrastructure
- **Created `RECOVERY.md`** — Comprehensive disaster recovery guide for zero-tech-knowledge rebuild
- **Config backup automation** — `backups/openclaw.json` auto-backed up via `scripts/auto-commit.sh`
- **Fixed 2 broken crons** — Model typo `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4` → `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-0` (SpaceX IPO Tracker, weekly-self-review)

### Cron Optimization
- Removed 8 stale/redundant crons
- Staggered morning crons: 7:20 → 8:30 → 9:30 SGT (was all clustered)
- SG Briefing: daily → Mon/Wed/Fri (60% "quiet news day" waste)
- Free Exploration: timeout 900→300s, added relevance gate
- Research Scan: added investment angle requirement

### Research Outputs
- `memory/research/nuclear-ai-power-nexus-2026-02-04.md` — Nuclear-AI deep dive
- `memory/opportunities/leu-haleu-play-2026-02-04.md` — Centrus (LEU) opportunity thesis
- `memory/opportunities/inference-cost-collapse-2026-02-04.md` — Inference cost thesis
- `memory/singapore/airshow-2026-family-guide.md` — Family guide for Feb 7-8

### Feedback Analysis
- Created `memory/feedback-analysis-2026-02-04-review.md`
- Updated `memory/what-works.md` with engagement patterns
- Formula: SPECIFIC + FRAMEWORK + ACTIONABLE = engagement

## Open Items
- Debugging duplicate message surfacing issue (Jon seeing same content multiple times)
- Surface tracker dedup may not be working properly
- SPY 671P expiring Feb 11 — position tracker cron set up

## Key Learnings
1. **Duck Principle** — 90% silent work, 10% high-value surfaces
2. **Finance gating working** — ~10% finance content target
3. **Model allocation matters** — Sonnet for crons/analysis, Opus for interactive
4. **Config backup critical** — Now automated daily

## Jon Context
- Singapore Airshow public days: Feb 7-8 (this weekend)
- CNY Year of the Horse: Feb 17
- Open position: SPY 671P exp Feb 11 (OTM, needs $18.53 drop from $689.53)
- NVDA earnings: Feb 25

## System Command Control Implemented (15:45 UTC)

- Created `memory/system-commands.json` - registry for controlling system-injected commands
- Updated HEARTBEAT.md with command filtering logic (check registry first)
- Disabled: MARKET SCOUT, SINGAPORE LIFE (misaligned with 5-shifts)
- Reframed: OPPORTUNITY HUNTER → CURIOSITY HUNTER, AUTOMATION SCOUT (remove financial framing)
- Kept frequencies: EMAIL SCOUT (every 3 days), SECURITY CHECK (monthly)
- Jon now has visible control over all system command behavior

## Pre-Compaction Memory Flush (15:48 UTC)

### Key Events Today

**Model Tiering Experiment:**
- Switched main session from Opus → Sonnet to test cost optimization
- Sonnet failed to maintain behavioral changes (5-shifts framework)
- Reverted to Opus - lesson: Sonnet understands but doesn't maintain paradigm shifts
- Sonnet good for structured execution, Opus needed for complex behavioral consistency

**5-Shifts Framework Implemented:**
1. Opportunity = intellectual discovery, NOT investment
2. Actionable = changes thinking, NOT tradeable
3. No justification needed for curiosity
4. Touch philosophy/spirituality from USER.md
5. Science as wonder, not alpha

**Topic Rebalancing:**
- Singapore lifestyle: 👎 received → DISABLED
- Finance framing: Still triggering despite documentation → logic bug identified and fixed
- Broader intellectual topics: Approved direction

**System Command Control Created:**
- `memory/system-commands.json` - registry for controlling injected commands
- MARKET SCOUT: Disabled (financial framing)
- SINGAPORE LIFE: Disabled (👎 feedback)
- OPPORTUNITY HUNTER: Reframed → CURIOSITY HUNTER
- AUTOMATION SCOUT: Reframed (remove financial angle)
- EMAIL SCOUT: Every 3 days (unchanged)
- SECURITY CHECK: Monthly (unchanged)

**Automations Built:**
- Smart Meal Recommender (`scripts/smart-meal-recommender.py`)
- Updated Kids Dinner Ideas cron to use learning system
- Market alerts set up (NVDA $175, QQQ $600)

**Security Issues Found:**
- API keys exposed in environment variables (OPENAI, GOOGLE, APIFY)
- Location: `~/.openclaw/.env` loaded into environment
- Recommended: Rotate keys, move to secure storage
- SSH brute force attempts detected but blocked by fail2ban

**AGI Vibe Assessment:**
- Autonomy: 30% (still need frequent correction)
- Human-like: 40% (can reflect, but pattern-completes)
- Self-correction: 35% (document errors but don't prevent)
- Steps to 60%: Pre-response checks, correction enforcement, anticipation mechanisms

### Key Lessons

1. **Model selection matters for behavioral consistency** - Sonnet can understand instructions but reverts to training patterns. Opus maintains complex behavioral changes.

2. **Documentation ≠ Implementation** - Writing down the 5-shifts didn't change behavior. Need enforcement mechanisms.

3. **User control over system commands** - Created registry so Jon can enable/disable/reframe injected commands.

4. **Corrections-per-day as autonomy metric** - Today: 5+ corrections. Target: <1.

### Jon's Feedback Signals
- 👎 on Singapore lifestyle content
- "yes" to broader intellectual topics
- Concern about financial framing persisting
- Wants visible control over system behavior
- Reverted to Opus for paradigm shifts

## Autonomy System Implementation (15:55 SGT)

Implemented full autonomy framework per Jon's directive:

**1. Pre-Response Self-Check** (`scripts/autonomy-check.py`)
- Checks responses for permission-asking patterns
- Validates against preference model
- Logs corrections for tracking
- Tracks anticipations for accuracy

**2. Preference Model** (`memory/preference-model.json`)
- Communication preferences (brevity, action bias)
- Content preferences (intellectual > financial)
- Anti-patterns to avoid (9 tracked)
- Positive/negative feedback signals

**3. Behavioral Tests** (`scripts/behavioral-test.py`)
- 6 test cases with weights
- Permission asking (2.0), file reference (1.5), sycophancy (1.0)
- Action bias (2.0), brevity (1.0), finance gating (1.5)

**4. Anti-Patterns Guide** (`ANTI-PATTERNS.md`)
- Canonical list of failures to avoid
- Required reading each session (already in AGENTS.md)

**5. Tracking Files**
- `memory/corrections-log.jsonl` — logs when I slip
- `memory/anticipations.jsonl` — tracks prediction accuracy

**6. Weekly Review Cron** (Sundays 10am SGT)
- Reviews correction patterns
- Updates preference model
- Target: <1 correction/day

**HEARTBEAT.md updated** with pre-response self-check gate.

Current autonomy estimate: ~50% (will increase as system learns)

### Daemon Research & Improvements (17:30 UTC)

**Research conducted:**
- Snowplow: Seven Principles of Ambient Agents
- MARS Framework (NTU Singapore): Metacognitive Agent Reflective Self-improvement
- OpenAI Cookbook: Self-Evolving Agents
- Temporal: Orchestrating Ambient Agents with Judge pattern

**Findings documented:** `memory/research/daemon-improvement-research-2026-02-04.md`

**Implemented:**
1. **MARS-typed reflections** — `reflexion.py` now supports:
   - `reflexion.py avoid` — Principle-based lessons (what NOT to do)
   - `reflexion.py procedures` — Procedural lessons (what TO do)
   - `reflexion.py mars` — Combined metacognitive view
   
2. **Daemon Judge** — New `scripts/daemon-judge.py`:
   - `health` — Overall daemon health score (engagement, success rate, activity)
   - `insights` — Pattern analysis for what's working vs not
   - `review` — Performance review for last N days
   
3. **Daemon Judge cron** — Weekly Sunday 4am SGT, runs self-evaluation cycle

4. **MARS Checkpoint in HEARTBEAT.md** — Before complex tasks:
   - AVOID CHECK: Query principle-based lessons
   - PROCEDURE CHECK: Query success strategies
   - CONFIDENCE: Estimate 1-10

**Key insight:** Separate "what to avoid" from "what works" for more efficient learning (single-cycle improvement vs multi-turn recursion).

## 21:36 — Daemon Feedback Loop Review

**Analysis performed on daemon outputs and feedback data.**

**Findings:**
- 👍 on: Pre-flight Check, alpha-map visualization, neuro-AI convergence deep dive
- Fast replies on: meta/daemon discussions, infrastructure
- Low engagement: overnight creative (0-2am SGT), financial API docs, generic briefings
- 43 crons = bloated, overlapping research coverage

**Changes made:**
1. ✅ Fixed 2 broken crons (wrong model `claude-sonnet-4` → `claude-sonnet-4-0`):
   - SpaceX IPO Tracker
   - weekly-self-review

2. ✅ Consolidated research crons:
   - Merged Cross-Domain Science into Research Paper Scan
   - Disabled redundant Cross-Domain Science cron

3. ✅ Enhanced Daily Free Exploration:
   - Added visual output requirement (visuals = engagement)
   - Added feedback tracking

4. ✅ Reduced Kids Dinner Ideas: daily → 3x/week (Mon/Wed/Fri)

5. ✅ Created `scripts/engagement-analyzer.py` for tracking

**Cron count:** 43 → 42 (disabled Cross-Domain Science)

**Next iteration:** 
- Need more surface→engagement tracking data
- Consider reducing crons to ~30 target
