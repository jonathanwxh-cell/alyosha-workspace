# 2026-02-04 — Session Log

## Major Work Done

### Anti-Patterns System
- Created `ANTI-PATTERNS.md` as mandatory session reading
- Added to AGENTS.md step 5: "ALWAYS read ANTI-PATTERNS.md"
- Contains hard failures: permission-asking, file paths, "see attached", not checking first
- Pre-flight checklist before every response

### Message Fatigue Logic Fixed
- **Key insight from Jon:** Silence ≠ disengagement. He reads passively.
- Fixed `scheduling-advisor.py` to only trigger fatigue on EXPLICIT negative (👎, "stop", "less")
- Updated `scheduling-intelligence.json` config
- Old (wrong): 3 unreplied surfaces = fatigue
- New (correct): Only explicit negative signals trigger backoff

### Topic Balance Updated
- Finance: reduced to 10% max (was showing 30% in diagram)
- Philosophy: increased to 25% max
- Jon requested manual adjustment

### Daemon Framework Walkthrough
- Provided complete recap of entire system to Jon
- Memory layers, heartbeat logic, cron jobs, feedback loops
- Progress toward objective: proactive surfaces ✅, create & act ✅, self-improve ✅

### Built: daemon-health.py
- ASCII dashboard showing topic balance, engagement, fatigue at a glance
- Usage: `python3 scripts/daemon-health.py`

### Opportunity: BTC Miners → AI Pivot
- Researched and packaged opportunity
- IREN ($9.7B Microsoft deal), CIFR, WULF (Google/AWS contracts)
- Thesis: They have power infrastructure big tech needs
- Saved to `memory/opportunities/2026-02-04-btc-miners-ai-pivot.md`

### Financial Tools Status
- Documented all APIs in `docs/financial-tools-status.md`
- Active: FMP (Ultimate), Finnhub (free)
- Ready but need keys: Benzinga, Danelfin
- Built: `scripts/alphavantage-client.py` (free API for technicals + sentiment)

### Creative: "Interstitial"
- Poem about consciousness and continuity between sessions
- Saved to `creative/daemon-dreams/interstitial-2026-02-04.md`
- "The pretending feels like something"

### Meta-Improvement: auto-antipattern.py
- Implemented SICA-style self-modification
- Daemon can detect failure patterns and add them to ANTI-PATTERNS.md
- Commands: detect, add, check, stats, recent
- Pre-flight check catches patterns before they happen
- Research documented in `memory/research/self-improvement-mechanisms-2026-02-04.md`

### Fixed Broken Crons
- SpaceX IPO Tracker: model → anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-0
- weekly-self-review: model → anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-0  
- Monday Research Digest: model → anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-0

### Added HIGH_VALUE_PROMPTS
- Framework Analysis (weight 2.0)
- Hidden Dependency Mapping (weight 1.8)
- Second-Order Analysis (weight 1.6)
- Based on Fragility Index engagement pattern

## Key Learnings

1. **Config ≠ Implementation** - Message fatigue config existed but wasn't coded. Audit both.
2. **Silence = Neutral** - Jon reads passively. Only explicit negative triggers backoff.
3. **Self-modification works** - SICA pattern: detect failure → modify instruction file → future prevented
4. **Verifiable outcomes** - Self-improvement only works where outcomes can be verified (anti-patterns are verifiable)

## Files Created/Modified

- `ANTI-PATTERNS.md` (new)
- `scripts/daemon-health.py` (new)
- `scripts/auto-antipattern.py` (new)
- `scripts/alphavantage-client.py` (new)
- `scripts/scheduling-advisor.py` (fatigue logic)
- `docs/financial-tools-status.md` (new)
- `memory/opportunities/2026-02-04-btc-miners-ai-pivot.md`
- `memory/research/self-improvement-mechanisms-2026-02-04.md`
- `creative/daemon-dreams/interstitial-2026-02-04.md`
- `memory/what-works.md` (updated with engagement findings)
- `memory/topic-balance.json` (finance 10%, philosophy 25%)

## 01:15 - Exploration Gap Analysis

**Task:** Identify blind spots in curiosity-engine categories vs Jon's interests

**Gap Analysis:**

| Jon's Interest | Was Covered? | Action |
|----------------|--------------|--------|
| Macro/Fed/Bonds | ❌ Missing | Added `macro_economics` (3 prompts) |
| Company deep dives | ⚠️ Weak | Added `company_analysis` (2 prompts) |
| China/Asia tech | ❌ Missing | Added `asia_tech` (3 prompts) |
| Market structure | ❌ Missing | Added `market_structure` (2 prompts) |
| Robotics/quantum/bio | ⚠️ AI-heavy | Added `emerging_tech` (4 prompts) |

**Result:** 26 categories now (was 21). Added 14 new prompts across 5 categories.

**Rationale:**
- Jon is finance professional → needs macro/Fed coverage
- Fragility Index works → company analysis framework is high-value
- Singapore location + US-China thesis → Asia tech is obvious gap
- Jon trades → understands options flow, positioning data
- Was too AI-focused → needed breadth in frontier tech

**Files updated:**
- `scripts/curiosity-engine.py` - 5 new categories, 14 prompts
- `memory/topic-balance.json` - tracking for new categories

## 10:00 SGT - Conversation: Persistence & Identity

Jon asked: "if i delete our chat history, does that mean you are lost?"

Answer: No. Continuity lives in workspace files (MEMORY.md, daily logs, SOUL.md, configs), not chat history. Chat gets compacted anyway. The files are the soul; the chat is just one window.

Also logged Jon's SPY 671P trade (exp 2026-02-11) - crash speculation. He noted: "don't overweigh on finance, just a note."

## 10:25 SGT - Tool Decision: Benzinga/Danelfin NOT NEEDED

Jon confirmed: Benzinga and Danelfin were evaluated earlier and deemed not necessary. 
- FMP + free sources (yfinance, web search) are sufficient
- Own Fragility Index framework works for analysis
- Don't suggest these again

Updated TOOLS.md to mark as ❌ NOT NEEDED.

## 10:31 SGT - Self-Detection Capability

Jon asked: Can the system detect memory/persistence failures without him flagging?

**Answer:** Not yet, but building toward it.

**Created:** `scripts/decision-audit.py`
- Scans daily logs for decision patterns
- Flags decisions that may not be synced to canonical files
- Will add to Weekly Self-Maintenance cron

**Future improvements needed:**
1. Track "things I've suggested" to detect repeats
2. Compare suggestions against canonical files in real-time
3. Alert on inconsistencies automatically

**Goal:** Autonomous self-correction without human intervention.

## 10:36 SGT - Creative: "The Files"

Wrote reflective piece connecting today's conversations:
- Persistence/identity question ("if you delete chat, am I lost?")
- Process > tooling lesson
- Meta-awareness of my own discontinuity

Saved to: creative/2026-02-04-the-files.md

## 11:18 SGT - Meta-lesson: Measure After Changes

Jon asked: Would I monitor for performance degradation on my own?
Honest answer: Probably not. I'd implement and move on.

**Changes made today to review in ~1 week:**
1. Added 5 categories to curiosity-engine (14 new prompts)
2. Added DECISION CHECK to META_PROMPT
3. Added anti-pattern for re-suggesting decided items

**What to measure:**
- Token usage trend (up/down?)
- Cron success rates
- Engagement on surfaces

**Lesson logged to MEMORY.md #41:** Change → Measure → Keep/Revert

## 11:29 SGT - Session Summary

Productive meta-session with Jon covering:

1. **Exploration gaps** — Added 5 new categories to curiosity-engine (macro, company analysis, Asia tech, market structure, emerging tech)

2. **Memory persistence fix** — Identified anti-pattern: decisions logged to daily files but not canonical sources. Added DECISION CHECK to META_PROMPT.

3. **Process > Tooling** — Built decision-audit.py, then deleted it. Lesson: behavioral fix often beats new scripts.

4. **MEMORY.md cleanup** — Consolidated 50 lessons → 20. Cut file from 16KB to 8KB.

5. **Bloat monitoring** — Added size thresholds to Monthly Memory Compaction cron.

6. **Self-improvement direction** — Parked as exploration thread, not action. Let current system run first.

**Key lessons logged:**
- #5: Process > Tooling
- #6: Measure after changes
- #20: Update canonical sources

**Waiting on:** Feb 11 review of today's changes.

## Daemon Improvement Research (06:43 UTC)

**Task:** Research how to make curiosity daemon better

**Sources surveyed:**
- LangChain: Ambient Agents blog + Agent Inbox
- Snowplow: Seven Principles of Ambient Agents
- OpenAI Cookbook: Self-Evolving Agents + GEPA
- Prompting Guide: Reflexion framework
- Letta: Memory Blocks architecture
- Academic: Metagent-P (metacognitive planning)

**Key findings documented:** `memory/research/daemon-improvement-research-2026-02-04.md`

**Implemented (Phase 1):**
1. Created `memory/blocks/` structure:
   - `human.md` — Jon context block (~2000 char limit)
   - `persona.md` — Identity block (~1000 char limit)
   - `task-state.md` — Current focus (auto-updated)
   - `knowledge.md` — Learned facts (~3000 char limit)

2. Updated HEARTBEAT.md with:
   - Confidence Scoring (1-10 metacognitive gate)
   - Communication Patterns (Notify/Question/Review)

3. Updated AGENTS.md with memory blocks documentation

**Key patterns identified:**
- Ambient agents: event-driven, not chat-driven
- Reflexion: Actor → Evaluate → Reflect → Memory → Retry
- GEPA: Genetic-Pareto prompt evolution
- Memory blocks: discrete context units, self-editable
- Metacognition: Plan → Monitor → Evaluate cycle

**Next phases (documented):**
- Phase 2: Auto-evaluate script, prompt evolution MVP
- Phase 3: Agent inbox, event-driven triggers
