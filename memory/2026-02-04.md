## Major Accomplishments

### Tools Built
- **`scripts/thesis-tracker.py`** — Investment thesis tracking with accountability ("what would change your view?")
- **`scripts/position-tracker.py`** — Open options position monitoring with DTE/ITM/OTM alerts
- Both documented in TOOLS.md

### Infrastructure
- **Created `RECOVERY.md`** — Comprehensive disaster recovery guide for zero-tech-knowledge rebuild
- **Config backup automation** — `backups/openclaw.json` auto-backed up via `scripts/auto-commit.sh`
- **Fixed 2 broken crons** — Model typo `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4` → `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-0` (SpaceX IPO Tracker, weekly-self-review)

### Cron Optimization
- Removed 8 stale/redundant crons
- Staggered morning crons: 7:20 → 8:30 → 9:30 SGT (was all clustered)
- SG Briefing: daily → Mon/Wed/Fri (60% "quiet news day" waste)
- Free Exploration: timeout 900→300s, added relevance gate
- Research Scan: added investment angle requirement

### Research Outputs
- `memory/research/nuclear-ai-power-nexus-2026-02-04.md` — Nuclear-AI deep dive
- `memory/opportunities/leu-haleu-play-2026-02-04.md` — Centrus (LEU) opportunity thesis
- `memory/opportunities/inference-cost-collapse-2026-02-04.md` — Inference cost thesis
- `memory/singapore/airshow-2026-family-guide.md` — Family guide for Feb 7-8

### Feedback Analysis
- Created `memory/feedback-analysis-2026-02-04-review.md`
- Updated `memory/what-works.md` with engagement patterns
- Formula: SPECIFIC + FRAMEWORK + ACTIONABLE = engagement

## Open Items
- Debugging duplicate message surfacing issue (Jon seeing same content multiple times)
- Surface tracker dedup may not be working properly
- SPY 671P expiring Feb 11 — position tracker cron set up

## Key Learnings
1. **Duck Principle** — 90% silent work, 10% high-value surfaces
2. **Finance gating working** — ~10% finance content target
3. **Model allocation matters** — Sonnet for crons/analysis, Opus for interactive
4. **Config backup critical** — Now automated daily

## Jon Context
- Singapore Airshow public days: Feb 7-8 (this weekend)
- CNY Year of the Horse: Feb 17
- Open position: SPY 671P exp Feb 11 (OTM, needs $18.53 drop from $689.53)
- NVDA earnings: Feb 25
