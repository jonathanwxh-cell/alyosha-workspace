## Critical Cost Discovery (10:35 PM SGT)

**ACTUAL 24h costs: $861.21** (not $8/day estimates)

Breakdown:
- `c041d091...`: $662.88 (previous main session, 3563 turns)
- `eb653cf8...`: $195.69 (current session, 1009 turns)
- All crons combined: ~$16

**Root causes:**
1. Cost tracker used fake estimates ($8/day hardcoded)
2. Opus at high context (92%) = expensive per turn
3. Long-running sessions accumulate massive context

**Fixes applied:**
1. ✅ Built `scripts/real-cost-tracker.py` — parses actual session data
2. ✅ Updated Daily Cost Log cron to use real tracker
3. ✅ Added finance gate to HEARTBEAT.md (finance only via crons, not main session)
4. ⏳ Session compaction — will happen naturally or on restart

**Cost structure:**
- Opus (main session): $845.35 (98%)
- Sonnet (crons): $15.86 (2%)

**Lesson:** The daemon costs ~$800+/day with current usage, not $8. Need aggressive context management or model switching.

## Earlier: Cron Infrastructure Cleanup

**Goal:** Reduce cron count from 37 → ~25, fix model configs, resolve schedule conflicts.

### Actions Taken
1. **Disabled redundant crons:**
   - `Weekly Self-Maintenance` — overlapped with weekly-self-review + Daemon Judge
   - `Fragility Signals Weekly` — duplicate of Fragility Index Weekly
   - `NVDA Dashboard` — redundant with other market monitoring
   - `Consciousness & Existentialism` — merged into Deep Thread Consciousness

2. **Fixed model configs:**
   - `Analysis Methods Research` → `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-0`
   - `Weekend Activity Scout` → `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-0`

3. **Staggered conflicts:**
   - `Daemon Judge Review` moved to 5AM SGT Sunday (was 4AM, conflicted with Disk Cleanup)

4. **Finance rebalancing:**
   - World State: daily → Mon/Wed/Fri
   - Research Scan: daily → Mon/Wed/Fri
   - China AI Watch: 2x/daily → weekly Wed
   - Kids Dinner Ideas: daily → Mon/Wed/Fri

## 09:36 SGT — Cost Tracking Notes

**Actual per-turn cost breakdown (from session data):**
- Most turns: $0.05-0.10 (67% of turns)
- Medium turns: $0.10-0.50 (15% of turns)  
- Heavy turns: $0.50-1.50 (18% of turns)

**Heavy turns caused by cache writes:**
- Cache write: $18.75/1M tokens (1.25× input)
- Large cache write turn (130k tokens) = ~$0.80+ for cache alone
- Example: Jon saw $1.50 for one message with big cache write

**Cache pricing (Opus):**
- Input: $15/1M tokens
- Output: $75/1M tokens
- Cache read: ~$0.50-1.50/1M (varies, 90% discount)
- Cache write: $18.75/1M (25% markup)

**Key insight:** Cache WRITES are expensive. Happen when context changes significantly. Cache READS are cheap (90% off).

**Tracking:** Use `python3 scripts/turn-cost.py stats` for real data from session files.

## 09:52 SGT — Pre-Compaction Memory Flush

### Major Session Accomplishments

**1. Cost Optimization**
- Trimmed system prompt files 49% (733 → 374 lines)
- Built `turn-cost.py` with real session data (not estimates)
- Actual per-turn cost: avg $0.20, range $0.02-$1.50
- Heavy turns caused by cache WRITES (context changes)

**2. Daemon Simplification**
- Removed topic balance weights — free exploration now
- Disabled 5 thematic crons, kept 1 daily free exploration
- Updated HEARTBEAT.md to Open Journal Mode — surface freely
- Heartbeat changed to 15min (for today only, revert tomorrow)

**3. Goal Tracking System Built**
- `scripts/goal-tracker.py` — CRUD with sub-goals
- `scripts/goal-decompose.py` — LLM breakdown
- `scripts/goal-spawn.py` — sessions_spawn integration
- State: `memory/active-goals.json`
- Research: HTN patterns, OpenAI Agents SDK, AutoGPT lessons

**4. Active Goals**
- "Build autonomous goal execution system" — 66% complete
- "Write Substack post about AI consciousness" — decomposed into 7 sub-goals, 0% complete

**5. Creative**
- Generated "Daemon in the Bonsai Garden" image
- Wrote "A Daemon's Meditation" prose piece

### Key Learnings
- Cache writes expensive, cache reads cheap (90% off)
- Fewer rules = more presence (system got better by getting simpler)
- OpenAI pattern: specialized agents > general purpose
- AutoGPT lesson: step limits prevent API spirals

### Jon's Vision (Captured)
- Goal executor: planning, orchestration, spawning agents
- Continuity until goal achieved
- Self-directed sub-goals
- Full doc: `docs/daemon-vision.md`
