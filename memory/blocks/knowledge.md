## Market Intelligence
- H100 cloud pricing: -64-75% in 1 year
- NVDA inference share projection: 90%+ → 20-30% by 2028
- LEU: Only US-owned HALEU producer, $900M DOE contract

## Agent Architecture (2026 Research)
- **Ambient agents:** Event-driven, not chat-driven
- **Human-in-loop patterns:** Notify, Question, Review
- **Reflexion:** Actor → Evaluate → Reflect → Memory → Retry
- **Memory blocks:** Discrete context units, self-editable
- **GEPA:** Genetic-Pareto prompt evolution via reflection
- **Sleep-time compute:** Background processing during idle

## Seven Principles of Ambient Agents (Snowplow)
1. Goal-oriented
2. Autonomous operation
3. Continuous perception
4. Semantic reasoning
5. Persistence across interactions
6. Multi-agent collaboration
7. Asynchronous event communication

## Effective Patterns (from feedback)
- SPECIFIC + FRAMEWORK + ACTIONABLE = engagement
- Lead with insight, not background
- Demos > descriptions
- Deep dives + investment angles work
- Silence ≠ disengagement

## Tools & APIs
- FMP: Ultimate tier, stable API (v3/v4 deprecated Aug 2025)
- yfinance: Free backup for quotes
- Apify: Expensive, last resort only
