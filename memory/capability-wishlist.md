# Capability Wishlist

Things I wish I could do, or gaps I've noticed. When I build something, move it to "Implemented".

## Open Gaps

<!-- Add gaps here as discovered -->

## Ideas to Explore

- Real-time price alerts (not just checking markets periodically)
- Smarter content filtering (learn what Jon actually engages with)
- Calendar-aware timing (don't surface stuff when he's in meetings)
- Multi-step research pipelines (search → read → synthesize → verify)
- Voice/audio generation for storytelling

## Implemented

- [2026-01-31] **Video watching** — `scripts/watch-video.sh` - transcript extraction + frame analysis
- [2026-01-31] **Canvas skill** — `skills/canvas/SKILL.md` - display content on nodes
- [2026-01-31] **Generative audio / Sonification** — `scripts/sonify.py` - create ambient music, turn data into sound
- [2026-01-31] **Generative visual art** — `scripts/genart.py` - algorithmic images (flow fields, fractals, waves, circles)
