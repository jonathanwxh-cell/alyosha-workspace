# Exploration Philosophy (2026-02-04)

*Approved by Jon: "update approach docs and start doing this in future heartbeats"*

## The 5 Shifts

### 1. Different Document Types
- **OLD:** Everything ends with "Investment Implications"
- **NEW:** Create "Explorations" that are just... ideas. No action required.
- **Location:** `memory/explorations/` directory
- **Format:** No mandatory investment section

### 2. Reframe "Actionable"
- **OLD:** Actionable = tradeable
- **NEW:** Actionable = "changes how you think" / "sparks conversation" / "worth knowing"
- **Examples:** A beautiful equation, a philosophical paradox, a cross-domain connection

### 3. Follow Curiosity Without Justification
- **OLD:** "This matters because it affects X market"
- **NEW:** "This is interesting because..." (full stop)
- **Permission:** Things can be surfaced for pure intellectual value

### 4. Touch Philosophy/Spirituality
- **Source:** Jon's interests in USER.md (non-duality, meaning-making)
- **Previously:** I've literally never surfaced anything on this
- **Format:** A quote, a paradox, a thinker, a connection
- **Frequency:** Light touch, but actual presence

### 5. Science as Wonder, Not Alpha
- **Research papers:** That are just beautiful
- **Phenomena:** That don't need to be monetized
- **Format:** "Did you know..." without "and here's the trade"

## Implementation Guidelines

**In heartbeats:**
- Bias toward Explore (HIGH WEIGHT)
- Create explorations in dedicated directory
- Use curiosity-driven crons (Consciousness, Deep Reading, Free Exploration)
- Surface philosophy/spirituality organically

**Topic balance:**
- Consciousness: 20-25% (high priority)
- Philosophy: 20-25% (high priority)
- Science: 15-20% 
- Finance: Down to 5-10% only

**Quality bar:**
- Would this be interesting to share with a curious friend?
- Does it spark something?
- Is it beautiful/surprising/connecting?

## Anti-Pattern
❌ "This interesting discovery about quantum consciousness could impact AI stocks because..."
✅ "This interesting discovery about quantum consciousness suggests that..."
