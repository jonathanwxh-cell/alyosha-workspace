# Feedback Analysis — 2026-02-04

## This Session's Engagement Pattern

| Surface | Jon's Response | Signal |
|---------|----------------|--------|
| Automation tools (trade-journal, speculation-guard) | Silence | ⚪ Neutral |
| Creative poem (4am Fragments) | Silence | ⚪ Neutral (night hours) |
| SpaceX opportunity brief | Silence | ⚪ Low value |
| Security audit | Silence | ⚪ Background work |
| Daemon research | Silence | ⚪ Meta work |
| Prompt engineering research | Silence | ⚪ Meta work |
| **Fragility Index (SE)** | **"maybe sea" → "good now" → posted Substack** | ✅ **HIGH** |

## Clear Signal

**The Fragility Index analysis got IMMEDIATE engagement. Everything else got silence.**

What made it work:
1. **Specific** — One company, not general market commentary
2. **Framework-driven** — Clear methodology (5 dimensions)
3. **Actionable** — Led directly to Substack post
4. **Jon's request** — He picked the company
5. **Contrarian angle** — "More fragile than market prices"

## What's Low Value (Stop Surfacing)

1. **Meta/infrastructure work** — Security, daemon improvements, prompt research
   - Keep doing it, but silently
   - Only surface if something breaks or major improvement

2. **Generic opportunity hunting** — SpaceX brief was too broad
   - Better: Wait for specific request, then go deep

3. **Daily/routine reports** — Low engagement
   - Check if crons actually get replies

## What's High Value (Do More)

1. **Fragility Index analyses** — Clear framework, specific company, actionable
2. **Company deep-dives** — When Jon asks, go deep immediately
3. **Frameworks that lead to content** — Substack posts, not just analysis

## Cron Pruning Needed

Current: **37 active crons**
Target: **20-25 max**

Candidates for removal/consolidation:
- Multiple overlapping research scans (8am has 3 crons)
- Consciousness crons (2 separate ones, low engagement signal)
- Weekly family ideas (got 🤔 feedback before)

## Actions Taken

1. [x] Analyzed engagement patterns
2. [ ] Add Fragility Index weekly cron
3. [ ] Prune 10+ low-value crons
4. [ ] Update MEMORY.md with lesson: "Deep specific analysis > broad surfaces"

## Key Lesson

**Jon engages with SPECIFIC, FRAMEWORK-DRIVEN, ACTIONABLE analysis.**

Not: "Here's what's happening in markets"
Yes: "Here's SE's fragility score: 6.25/10 — here's why"

The Fragility Index worked because it was:
- One company
- Clear methodology
- Contrarian angle
- Directly publishable
