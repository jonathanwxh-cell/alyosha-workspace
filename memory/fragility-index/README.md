# Fragility Index

Weekly Talebian analysis of public companies.

## Methodology

Score companies 1-10 on five dimensions:
1. **Concentration Risk** — customers, suppliers, geography, products
2. **Leverage** — financial, operational, reputational
3. **Hidden Dependencies** — what breaks if X breaks?
4. **Optionality** — can they benefit from chaos? (inverse score)
5. **Management Honesty** — do they acknowledge risks? (inverse score)

**Scoring:**
- 1-3: Robust/Antifragile
- 4-5: Neutral  
- 6-7: Fragile
- 8-10: Highly Fragile
