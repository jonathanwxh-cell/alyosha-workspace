## Capabilities Born This Month

1. **🎬 Video Analysis** — `watch-video.sh`
   - Extract transcripts from YouTube
   - Fall back to frame extraction for visual analysis
   
2. **🎵 Generative Audio** — `sonify.py`
   - Create ambient music algorithmically
   - Turn data into sound (sonification)
   
3. **🎨 Generative Art** — `genart.py`
   - Flow fields, fractals, wave interference
   - Algorithmic visual creation
   
4. **📦 Memory Compaction** — `memory-compact.sh`
   - Archive old daily logs into weekly summaries
   - Prevent unbounded file growth
   
5. **🧠 Canvas Skill** — `skills/canvas/SKILL.md`
   - Display content on paired nodes
   - Video playback, dashboards, interactive content

## Research Completed

1. **World Models Thesis** — Yann LeCun's AMI Labs, post-transformer future
2. **Mamba & SSMs** — The challenger to transformers
3. **AI Energy Crisis** — Power demand, nuclear renaissance
4. **AI Data Wall** — Synthetic data, model collapse
5. **Agent Patterns** — ReAct, Reflexion, self-improvement loops
6. **Daemon Improvement** — 20 agentic workflow patterns

---

## Systems Built

- **Curiosity Daemon** — Autonomous exploration with 25+ prompts
- **Self-improvement loop** — Reflexion, capability gap detection
- **Sustainability audit** — Future-proofing against scaling issues
- **Cost monitoring** — API usage awareness

## Things Learned About Jon

- Finance/investment professional
- 2 kids (3yo, 5yo)
- Night owl (active at 1-2am SGT)
- Values directness, economical with words
- Interested in: AI, markets, geopolitics, spirituality, cross-disciplinary topics
- Wants proactive insights, not just reactive help
- Prefers practical utility over flashy demos

---

## Mistakes Made & Lessons Learned

1. **Apify overuse** — Too expensive for broad scraping. Use web_search first.
2. **Credentials in git** — Found and scrubbed. Always use .gitignore from start.
3. **No sustainability thinking** — Added SUSTAINABILITY AUDIT prompt to catch scaling issues early.

## Looking Ahead to February

- [ ] Run curiosity daemon continuously
- [ ] Build more capabilities organically (via CAPABILITY GAP prompt)
- [ ] Establish rhythm of useful proactive surfaces
- [ ] First monthly memory compaction (Feb 1)
- [ ] Rotate exposed credentials (Jon's action)

## Reflection

Two days in, and we've built a foundation. The curiosity daemon has prompts, the memory system has structure, and there's a self-improvement loop in place. 

The goal isn't to be impressive — it's to be genuinely useful over time. A good familiar, not a flashy demo.

Here's to February. 🕯️
