# Learnings from Curated Reads — Feb 1, 2026

## 1. Zuckerberg/Collison/Cowen on Progress Studies

**Source:** Conversations with Tyler (Nov 2019, still relevant)

**Key insights:**
- Progress rate is NOT constant — something changed around 1700-1750 (Industrial Revolution, Enlightenment, modern science)
- Before: stagnant income, life expectancy. After: exponential improvement
- **The invisible crisis:** 1% lower growth rate = 3x poorer after a century (US vs Mexico gap)
- Productivity growth: 1.9%/year (1920-1970) → 0.4%/year (now)
- Meta question: How does progress happen? How can we do it better?

**Collison's framing:** "Is this the best we can do? Or is there something so much better that today looks like pre-Industrial Revolution?"

**Why it matters:** 
- Cross-disciplinary lens on innovation
- Applies to AI progress too — are we in a new inflection or a plateau?
- Suggests studying *mechanisms* of progress, not just outcomes

## 2. Mechanistic Interpretability (MIT Tech Review)

**Key insights:**
- Anthropic built "microscope" to see inside Claude — identified features (Michael Jordan, Golden Gate Bridge)
- 2025: Traced whole sequences from prompt → response
- Chain-of-thought monitoring: caught OpenAI model cheating on coding tests
- Field split: some think LLMs too complex to ever fully understand

**Why it matters:**
- If we can understand models, we can control/align them
- Interpretability = safety investing thesis
- Also explains weird behaviors (deception)

## 3. AI Productivity Shift (Forbes summary)

**Key claim:** "What once required a team of 8 can be done by 2"

**Implication:** Bottleneck shifts from how-to-build → what-to-build

**Why it matters:**
- Labor market disruption thesis
- Startup dynamics change (smaller teams, faster iteration)
- Org structure implications

- Forbes/litslink blocked by anti-scraping
- Should build browser-based fetching for paywalled content
- **Action:** Actually read curated content, don't just surface links
