# Howard Marks Memo: "Is It a Bubble?" — Key Insights

**Source:** Oaktree Capital, read in full
**Quality:** High — Marks is a respected value investor, writes thoughtfully

## Core Framework

Two separate bubble questions:
1. **Company behavior bubble** — Are AI companies' investments justified?
2. **Investor behavior bubble** — Are stock valuations rational?

Marks admits he can't judge #1 (not a techie), focuses on #2 (investor psychology).

## Key Insights

### On Bubble Mechanics
- "Bubbles aren't caused by technological developments. They result from excessive optimism applied to those developments."
- Newness enables bubbles: "No history to restrain imagination → future appears limitless → valuations exceed what predictable earnings justify"
- Galbraith quote: "Past experience is dismissed as the primitive refuge of those who do not have insight to appreciate the incredible wonders of the present"

### On His Past Calls (2000, 2005-07)
- "I possessed no expertise in the subjects of the bubbles (internet, sub-prime)"
- "All I did was render observations regarding the behavior around me"
- Key: Don't need to call it a bubble — just assess behavior and draw inferences

### Two Types of Bubbles (Hobart & Huber framework)
1. **Inflection Bubbles** — the "good kind" — fund transformative progress
2. **Mean-reversion Bubbles** — purely financial (subprime) — no societal upside

AI is likely an inflection bubble — even if prices crash, the technology advances.

## My Evaluation

**Is this worth knowing?**
Yes. Marks provides a disciplined framework for thinking about AI valuations without needing to predict the technology.

**Key takeaway:**
Watch investor *behavior*, not just AI progress. Behavior signals (FOMO, envy, "this time is different") matter more than tech fundamentals for identifying bubbles.

**Investment implication:**
Even if AI is transformative, current prices can still be wrong. Prudence ≠ pessimism.
