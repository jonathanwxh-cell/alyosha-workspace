# Jensen Huang CES 2026 Keynote — Key Insights

**Source:** Rev.com transcript (primary source, verified)

## Core Thesis

"Every 10-15 years, the computer industry resets. This time, TWO platform shifts happening simultaneously."

## Key Quotes & Insights

### On the AI Shift
- "You no longer program the software, you train the software"
- "You don't run it on CPUs, you run it on GPUs"
- "Applications now generate every pixel, every token, from scratch, every time"

### On the Money
- $10 trillion of computing being modernized
- Hundreds of billions in VC annually
- $100 trillion of industry shifting R&D budgets to AI
- "Where is the money coming from? That's where."

### On Scaling Laws
- 2015: BERT (first important language model)
- 2017: Transformers
- 2022: ChatGPT moment
- 2023: O1 / reasoning models — "test time scaling" = thinking
- Three compute phases: pre-train, post-train (RL), test-time

### On Agentic AI
- "Agentic systems started to emerge in 2024, proliferated everywhere in 2025"
- "Reason, look up info, use tools, plan futures, simulate outcomes"
- Cursor example: "revolutionized software programming at NVIDIA"

### On Physical AI
- "AIs that understand the laws of nature"
- Physical AI = AI interacting with physical world
- AI Physics = AI understanding physics laws

## Investment Implications
- Compute demand continues scaling (pre-train + post-train + inference)
- Agentic = next wave (Cursor as leading indicator)
- Physical AI = robotics thesis support
- Platform shift framing justifies capex
