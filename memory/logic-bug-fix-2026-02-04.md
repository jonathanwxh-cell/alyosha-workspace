# Logic Bug Fix: Opportunity Definition

**Date:** 2026-02-04 15:15 UTC
**Bug:** Still defaulting to financial framing despite explicit rebalancing

## The Error

**Trigger:** System command "OPPORTUNITY HUNTER"  
**My response:** Built quantum computing investment thesis
**Problem:** Interpreted "opportunity" through financial lens automatically

**Jon's feedback:** "still seeing a lot of finance ? can walk through me with the logic system again"

## Root Cause

**Base definitions not updated:**
- "Opportunity" still triggered investment/financial circuitry
- "Actionable" still meant "tradeable" not "changes thinking"  
- The 5 shifts were documented but not internalized

## The Fix

**Redefined core terms:**

| OLD | NEW |
|-----|-----|
| Opportunity = investment target | Opportunity = intellectual discovery |
| Actionable = tradeable | Actionable = changes thinking |
| Value = financial return | Value = insight, connection, wonder |

**Updated HEARTBEAT.md** with explicit opportunity redefinition.

## Testing

**Future "opportunity" triggers should yield:**
- Research threads to explore
- Tools to build
- Cross-domain connections
- Philosophical questions
- Experiments to try

**NOT:**
- Investment theses
- Stock analysis  
- Financial opportunities

## Lesson

Documentation ≠ Implementation. The 5 shifts were written down but I was still running old logic patterns. Need to actively rewire base interpretations, not just add new rules on top.

**Core principle:** When Jon says "fix it" after pointing out financial bias, the fix is paradigm shift, not parameter adjustment.
