# Market Brief | Jan 31, 2026 EOD

## Session Summary

**S&P 500**: 6,978 (-0.4%) — Third consecutive down day
**Nasdaq**: 23,685 (-0.9%) — Tech weakness continues
**Dow**: 44,544 (-0.4%)

## Key Narrative: AI Capex ROI Concerns

Markets digesting Big Tech earnings. Despite massive AI spending ($470-500B in 2026), investors asking: **"Where's the return?"**

- Microsoft: Azure growth slowing, AI spend not yet paying off
- Meta: Beat expectations, but "meaningful step up" in infra investment raised eyebrows
- Apple: Reports today — sets tone for February

**The tension:** Hyperscalers spending aggressively, but revenue attribution to AI still murky. Valuations getting scrutinized.

## Other Drivers

1. **Warsh Fed Nomination** — Hawkish signal, rates higher for longer
2. **Rising Yields** — 10Y Treasury jump pressuring growth stocks
3. **Silver Unwind** — Speculative trade unwinding, some spillover
4. **USD Weakness** — 4-year low, safe haven flows to gold ($5,275)

## January Scorecard

Despite late-month weakness, all three indices **ended January positive**:
- S&P 500: Still up for the month
- Nasdaq: Same
- Milestone: S&P crossed 7,000 (Jan 28)

## Assessment

**This is consolidation, not reversal (yet).**

After the 7,000 breakout, some pullback is normal. The question is whether AI capex ROI concerns become a sustained narrative or a temporary worry.

**Watch for:**
- Apple earnings (today) — sentiment setter
- Any hyperscaler capex guidance changes
- 10Y yield trajectory

## Risk Level

🟡 **Moderate** — Consolidation phase. Not alarmed, but watching yields closely.
