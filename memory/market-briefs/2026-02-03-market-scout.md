## 🔥 Story 1: Palantir Crushes Expectations

**What happened:** Q4 2025 earnings released Feb 2

| Metric | Result | vs YoY |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Q4 Revenue Growth | 70% | Blowout |
| US Commercial Revenue | +137% | Acceleration |
| FY26 Revenue Guidance | +61% | Above consensus |
| US Commercial Guidance | +115% | Crushing expectations |
| EPS | $0.25 adj | vs $0.14 prior year |

**Why it matters:**
- AI enterprise adoption accelerating faster than expected
- Government + commercial both firing
- Stock up 5%+ after hours
- Validates AI capex thesis (NVDA ecosystem)

**Second-order:** If Palantir is seeing 137% US commercial growth, what does that say about enterprise AI adoption broadly?

## 🇮🇳 Story 2: US-India Trade Deal

**What happened:** Trump announces tariff reduction

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| 25% reciprocal tariff | 18% |
| +25% Russia oil penalty | Removed |
| India buying Russian oil | India agrees to stop |

**Market reaction:**
- Sensex: +3,500 points (historic single-day gain)
- Nifty: Broke above 26,400

**Why it matters:**
- Geopolitical realignment: India moving away from Russia
- US using tariffs as leverage effectively
- Emerging market risk-on signal

**Second-order:** Russia loses major oil customer. Energy market implications?

## 📉 Story 3: Gold/Silver Historic Crash

**What happened:** Precious metals rout

| Metal | Drop | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| Gold | -10% Friday, extended losses | Biggest since 2013 |
| Silver | -16% intraday | Record single-day drop |
| Gold price | $5,600 → $4,465 | ~20% from peak |

**Triggers:**
- CME margin hikes compounding
- Crowded long positioning unwound
- Risk-on rotation (equities up)
- Dollar strength

**Why it matters:**
- Historic volatility in "safe haven"
- Many funds caught wrong-footed
- Fragility in precious metals positioning exposed

**Talebian note:** This is what fragile positions look like when they break. The very "safety" of gold attracted crowded positions that created fragility.

## Quick Stats

| Index | Move | YTD |
|-------|------|-----|
| S&P 500 | +0.5% (approaching ATH) | Strong |
| Nasdaq | +0.6% | Tech leading |
| Russell 2000 | +1% | +6% YTD |
| Dow | +515 pts Monday | Solid |

## Watchlist Implications

- **PLTR:** AI enterprise adoption thesis validated
- **NVDA:** Dipped ~3% on OpenAI $100B deal stall news, rebounding +1% premarket. Palantir AI adoption = still bullish for GPU demand.
- **India ETFs (INDA, EPI):** Trade deal tailwind
- **GLD/SLV:** Bounce or more pain? Watch CME margins

## NVDA Specific Note

News emerged that NVIDIA's planned $100B investment in OpenAI has stalled. Jensen Huang reportedly expressed concerns about OpenAI's "lack of discipline" and competition from Google/Anthropic. Stock dipped ~3% Monday but recovering.

**Read:** Not a demand issue, more about capital allocation discipline. Core GPU demand thesis intact (see Palantir numbers).
