# Market Brief: Feb 4, 2026 Evening

## Major Moves

### 🚀 SMCI +14% — AI Infrastructure Validation
- **Q2 Revenue:** $12.7B vs $10.4B expected (+123% YoY)
- **EPS:** $0.69 vs $0.49 expected  
- **FY26 Guidance:** Raised to $40B
- **Signal:** AI server demand accelerating, not slowing
- **NVDA Impact:** Bullish — validates continued hyperscaler capex

### 💊 NVO -6% (was -15%) — GLP-1 Pricing Collapse
- **2026 Guidance:** Cut 5-13% on sales
- **Cause:** "Unprecedented" US price pressure
- **Wegovy:** Price cuts incoming
- **Competition:** Ozempic facing generic threat
- **Winner:** LLY (+10%) taking share

### ☀️ ENPH +39% — Solar Surprise
- Strong revenue forecast despite macro headwinds
- Q4 revenue $343M beat expectations

### 📉 Tech Rotation Continues
- GOOGL -2%, broader tech weakness
- But AI infrastructure (SMCI) diverging positively
- Market distinguishing "AI beneficiaries" from "tech generally"

## Key Insight

**Divergence emerging:** Tech giants (GOOGL, META rotation) vs AI infrastructure (SMCI ripping). Market is now discriminating — not all tech is the same. Pure AI capex plays outperforming.

**NVO paradigm shift:** The GLP-1 pricing power thesis is breaking. This was a $500B+ market cap story built on pricing power. Now facing "unprecedented" pressure. Could cascade to other high-multiple pharma.

## Watch
- SMCI momentum into NVDA earnings (Feb 25)
- NVO stabilization or further breakdown
- LLY as GLP-1 winner-take-more
