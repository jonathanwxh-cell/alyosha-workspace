## Narrative

**What's happening:**
- Rotation OUT of tech giants (safe havens during uncertainty)
- Rotation INTO economically sensitive / small caps / value
- Dow hit new record while Nasdaq sold off

**Catalysts:**
1. **Geopolitical flare-up** — Lifting oil (+3%), safe havens
2. **AI disruption fears** — "Advances in AI will undermine traditional business models"
3. **Valuation reset** — Tech stretched after 2025 run
4. **Growth expectations** — Improving outlook favors cyclicals

**Commodities:**
- Oil: +3% (geopolitical risk premium)
- Gold: Bouncing after historic rout
- Bitcoin: Lowest since Nov 2024

## Position Check

**SPY 671P exp 2026-02-11:**
- Current: $683.60
- Strike: $671
- Gap: $12.60 (1.9% OTM)
- DTE: 7 days
- **Status:** Closer but still needs ~1.9% drop

The tech rotation helps the put thesis (SPY weakness) but timing is tight. Need acceleration or specific catalyst.

## Watch Items

1. **NVDA sub-$170** — Psychological level, would signal broader AI concern
2. **SPY $675** — Getting close to strike
3. **VIX spike** — Fear indicator
4. **Oil >$80** — Geopolitical escalation

## Talebian Lens

**Fragile:** Tech concentration, AI capex assumptions, Bitcoin leverage
**Antifragile:** Commodities (benefit from chaos), value stocks, cash
**Convex bet:** SPY puts if rotation accelerates
