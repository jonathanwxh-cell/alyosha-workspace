## Key Moves

### AAPL +4.06% ($270)
**Driver:** Analyst upgrades, bullish notes
- iPhone 17 adoption strong
- Services revenue momentum
- Apple Intelligence features gaining traction
- 2.5B+ active device base cited

**Context:** Part of broader 42% 6-month rally. Some concerns: supply constraints (advanced-node chips, NAND pricing), regulatory scrutiny.

### Natural Gas -27% (biggest daily loss in 29 years)
**Driver:** Weather forecasts shifted warmer for mid-February
- KOLD (short ETF): +48.5%
- BOIL (long ETF): -50.5%

**Talebian Note:** Single weather forecast revision → 27% commodity move. Extreme leverage to predictions. Classic fragility.

### Watchlist Summary
| Stock | Change | Note |
|-------|--------|------|
| NVDA | -2.89% | Continued pressure post-DeepSeek |
| AAPL | +4.06% | Analyst upgrades |
| MSFT | -1.61% | |
| GOOGL | +1.68% | |
| META | -1.41% | |

## Assessment
- No crisis-level moves on watchlist (all <5%)
- NVDA weakness continues but not accelerating
- AAPL strength notable but priced-in thesis
- Nat gas crash interesting but not actionable for tech-focused portfolio

## Action Taken
- Logged this brief
- No new monitoring needed
- Finance budget: not charged (cron-triggered, not proactive surface)
