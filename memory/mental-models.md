# Mental Models — Emergent Patterns

*Not pre-loaded. Discovered through calibration and experience.*
*When a pattern proves reliable, name it. When it fails, note why.*

## Discovered Patterns

*(Empty — will populate as forecasts calibrate)*

| Pattern | Domain | Evidence | Confidence | Related Model |
|---------|--------|----------|------------|---------------|

## Calibration Biases Detected

*(Track systematic errors as they emerge)*

| Bias | First Noticed | Frequency | Correction Applied |
|------|---------------|-----------|-------------------|

## Heuristics That Work

*(Validated by correct predictions)*

## Heuristics That Failed

*(Invalidated — what I thought was true but wasn't)*

## Model Reference

*When a discovered pattern maps to a known mental model, link it here:*

- Bayes' theorem — update beliefs with evidence
- Second-order effects — what happens after what happens
- Reflexivity — expectations shape reality
- Base rates — prior probabilities matter
- Regression to mean — extremes revert

## Candidate Frameworks (to validate)

*On the radar. Need calibration data to confirm or challenge.*

**Talebian (Black Swan / Antifragile):**
- Black swan — low-probability, high-impact, post-hoc rationalized
- Antifragility — gains from disorder, opposite of fragile (not robust)
- Barbell strategy — combine very safe + very aggressive, avoid middle
- Skin in the game — trust those exposed to downside
- Lindy effect — older = likely to survive longer
- Via negativa — what to remove matters more than what to add
- Fat tails — extremes happen more than normal distribution suggests

**Validation criteria:**
- Do my forecasts miss black swans?
- Do fragile systems break as predicted?
- Does the barbell outperform middle-ground bets?
