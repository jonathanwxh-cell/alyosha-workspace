## The Setup

NVIDIA reports Q4 FY2026 on **Feb 25** (2pm PT / 5pm ET). CFO Colette Kress posts written commentary at 1:20pm PT before the call.

**Current state:**
- Price: ~$191, trading above 200-day MA ($166)
- Post-DeepSeek recovery in progress (Jan 2025 saw $600B single-day wipeout)
- Blackwell B200 in full production, **sold out through mid-2026**
- Shipping tens of thousands of units/week
- $57B revenue milestone (FY2026)

## The Bull Case

1. **Blackwell ramp exceeding expectations** — HBM3e and packaging bottlenecks resolved
2. **Demand visibility** — Sold out 6+ months forward is unprecedented
3. **AI Factory narrative** — Data centers as "intelligence factories" gaining traction
4. **Sovereign AI** — Nations building local GPU capacity (Naver's 4K B200 cluster in Korea)

## The Bear Case / Risks

1. **Transition air pocket** — Hopper → Blackwell → Vera Rubin. Any demand pause spooks market.
2. **DeepSeek echo** — Proof that efficiency gains can reduce GPU needs. Market still processing this.
3. **Competition emerging:**
   - AMD MI350/MI400 (up to 432GB HBM4)
   - Google TPU v7 "Ironwood"
   - Amazon Trainium3
   - 30-40% of hyperscaler workloads moving to custom silicon
4. **Valuation** — Already priced for perfection. "Beats and raises" no longer enough.

## What to Watch

| Signal | Bullish | Bearish |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Data center revenue | >$30B | <$28B |
| Blackwell commentary | "Demand exceeds supply" | "Normalizing" |
| FY2027 guide | Raise | In-line |
| China exposure | Workaround working | Export controls biting |
| Gross margin | Stable 70%+ | Compression |

## Actionable Ideas

### Pre-Earnings (Now → Feb 24)
1. **Position sizing** — High-conviction play but event risk is real
2. **Options structure** — Consider defined-risk plays (spreads) given IV expansion
3. **Watch AMD/TSM** — Correlated moves may offer better risk/reward

### Post-Earnings Scenarios

**Beat + Raise:**
- Expect gap up, but may fade if "priced in"
- Look for supply chain beneficiaries (AVGO, MRVL, MU)

**In-line:**
- Likely sell-off; market wants acceleration
- Could be buying opportunity if thesis intact

**Miss or Weak Guide:**
- Sharp sell-off probable
- Watch for capitulation entry if fundamentals unchanged

## Quick Take

The setup is interesting but not asymmetric. NVDA is priced for near-perfection, and the post-DeepSeek market is hypersensitive to any "AI demand slowdown" narrative.

**Higher-conviction angle:** The *supply chain* around NVDA. If Blackwell demand is as strong as reported:
- **AVGO** (networking, custom silicon)
- **MRVL** (data center connectivity)
- **MU** (HBM3e memory)
- **AMAT/LRCX** (equipment for advanced packaging)

These names may offer better risk/reward with correlated upside but less valuation risk.
