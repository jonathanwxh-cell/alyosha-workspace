# NVIDIA Rubin Platform — Investment Thesis Update

*Created: 2026-02-01 from CES 2026 announcements*

---

## What's New

**Rubin Platform now in FULL PRODUCTION** — not announced, shipping.

This is Blackwell's successor. Key specs:
- **10x cost reduction** for AI token generation
- **50 petaflops** NVFP4 inference per Rubin GPU
- **6-chip extreme codesign**: Rubin GPUs + Vera CPUs + NVLink 6 + Spectrum-X Photonics + ConnectX-9 + BlueField-4

Jensen: "$10 trillion of the last decade of computing is now being modernized."

## Thesis Implications

### Bull Case Strengthened

1. **Economics improve for customers = more demand, not less**
   - 10x cheaper tokens → Jevons Paradox (our Substack thesis)
   - Inference demand can explode when cost drops this much
   
2. **Full-stack moat deepens**
   - Not just GPUs: CPUs (Vera), networking, storage, DPUs
   - Extreme codesign = competitors can't match single components
   
3. **Open model strategy = ecosystem lock-in**
   - 6 domain-specific model families (healthcare, climate, robotics, AV, etc.)
   - Free models → train on NVIDIA → deploy on NVIDIA

4. **Physical AI is next S-curve**
   - Cosmos (world models for robotics)
   - Alpamayo (autonomous driving) — Mercedes CLA shipping this year
   - GR00T (embodied AI)

### Risks / Watch Items

1. **China exposure** — export controls, revenue impact
2. **Customer concentration** — hyperscalers could push back on pricing
3. **Rubin ramp execution** — production ≠ shipped at scale

## Connection to Earnings (Feb 25)

Questions for the call:
1. Rubin production volumes vs Blackwell?
2. Customer commitments for Rubin?
3. China revenue guidance given restrictions?
4. Physical AI (Cosmos/Alpamayo) monetization timeline?

## Antifragile Angle

NVIDIA gains from AI chaos:
- Model competition → all need compute
- Efficiency improvements → usage expands (Jevons)
- New domains (robotics, AV) → new TAM

The more the AI landscape shifts, the more NVIDIA supplies the picks and shovels.
