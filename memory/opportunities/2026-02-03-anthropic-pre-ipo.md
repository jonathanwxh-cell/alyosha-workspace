## Bull Case

1. **Revenue growth:** 3x in 6 months, projected another 3x in 2026
2. **Enterprise moat:** Claude 3.5/4 competitive with GPT-4, safety reputation
3. **Strategic investors:** Google, Amazon, Microsoft, NVIDIA all in
4. **AI spend continues:** Hyperscalers still aggressively investing

## Bear Case

1. **Valuation:** $350B for $9B revenue = 39x forward (expensive)
2. **Competition:** OpenAI, Google, Meta all have strong models
3. **Secondary market risks:** Illiquidity, lockups, pricing uncertainty
4. **Regulation:** AI safety could cut both ways

## Risk/Reward

| Scenario | Prob | Return | Assumption |
|----------|------|--------|------------|
| Bull | 30% | +100% | IPO at $500B+, AI dominance |
| Base | 45% | +30% | IPO at $400-450B, steady growth |
| Bear | 25% | -40% | Competition erodes moat, regulatory pressure |

**Expected value:** +24%

## Action Required

**If interested:**
1. Check accredited investor status
2. Create account on Hiive or Augment
3. Review available orders (min investment varies)
4. Consider position size (illiquid, high-risk)

**Note:** Secondary market shares may have transfer restrictions, lockup periods, and less transparency than public markets.
