# Opportunity: Bitcoin Miners → AI/HPC Pivot

**Date:** 2026-02-04
**Category:** Equities - Small/Mid Cap Tech Infrastructure
**Thesis:** Former Bitcoin miners pivoting to AI data centers have asymmetric upside

---

## The Setup

Bitcoin miners are exiting mining and pivoting to AI/HPC infrastructure:
- They already own power infrastructure + land
- GPU-as-a-Service is more profitable than mining
- Big tech is signing multi-billion contracts with them
- De-risked from Bitcoin volatility while capturing AI demand

**VanEck's view:** "Cleanest consolidation setup since 2020-2021... best risk-reward in miners transitioning into energy-backed compute platforms."

## Key Players

| Ticker | Price | MCap | 2025 Move | Key Contract |
|--------|-------|------|-----------|--------------|
| **IREN** | $54.39 | $17.9B | +360% | $9.7B Microsoft deal (NVIDIA GB300 GPUs) |
| **CIFR** | $16.26 | $6.4B | +160% | Multi-billion Google Cloud + AWS |
| **WULF** | $14.80 | $6.2B | +100% | Multi-billion Google Cloud + AWS |
| **HUT** | $59.02 | $6.4B | +varies | $7B Google-backed deal |

## 2026 Projections

- **TeraWulf (WULF):** 132% revenue growth projected
- **Cipher (CIFR):** 66% revenue growth projected
- **Bitfarms:** Says AI could produce more NOI than BTC mining ever did

---

## The Talebian Angle

**Antifragile to Bitcoin volatility:**
- Old model: 100% correlated to BTC price + hash rate
- New model: Long-term HPC contracts with big tech = stable revenue

**Convexity:**
- Downside: AI demand slows (but contracts locked in)
- Upside: AI demand accelerates beyond projections

**Hidden dependency they solved:**
- Power infrastructure is THE bottleneck for AI
- They already have it

## Risks

1. **Execution risk:** Mining ≠ data center operations (different expertise)
2. **Valuation:** Already up 100-360% in 2025
3. **Competition:** Traditional data center operators
4. **Concentration:** Heavy reliance on few big tech contracts

---

## Actionable

**If interested:**
1. Deep dive on CIFR or WULF (smaller, more upside potential)
2. Check Q4 earnings for HPC revenue breakdown
3. Watch for additional contract announcements

**Position sizing consideration:** High volatility names, size accordingly
