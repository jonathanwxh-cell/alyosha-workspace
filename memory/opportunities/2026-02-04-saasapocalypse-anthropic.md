## Market Carnage

| Company | Sector | Drop | Notes |
|---------|--------|------|-------|
| **Thomson Reuters** | Legal data | **-18%** | Direct competitor |
| **Relx** | Info/analytics | **-14%** | Legal division exposed |
| **Wolters Kluwer** | Legal software | **-13%** | Direct competitor |
| **LSE Group** | Data services | **-13%** | Collateral damage |
| **Sage** | Business software | **-10%** | Automation fear |
| **Pearson** | Publishing | **-8%** | AI education threat |
| **Experian** | Credit reporting | **-7%** | Data moat questioned |

**Total market cap destruction:** Billions in a single day.

## Investment Thesis

### Bear Case (Disruption)
- AI can now do what these companies charge subscription fees for
- "At the very least, reduces margins; worst-case, disintermediates them entirely" — AJ Bell
- Legal/professional services = high-margin, high-disruption target
- Clifford Chance already cut 10% London staff citing AI

### Bull Case (Oversold?)
- These companies have data moats, relationships, trust
- AI tools need data to train on — creates dependency
- Enterprise sales cycles are long; disruption takes years
- Thomson Reuters -18% in a day seems extreme

### The Pattern
This is the **DeepSeek playbook** repeating:
1. AI company launches capability
2. Incumbents crater on fear
3. Reality somewhere in between
4. Opportunity in the volatility

## Actionable Ideas

1. **Short-term bounce trade** — Thomson Reuters -18% is likely oversold
2. **Long-term short** — If AI really disrupts, Wolters Kluwer most exposed
3. **Picks-and-shovels** — Who provides the data AI needs to train? (Could be same companies)
4. **Watch for copycats** — OpenAI, Google will follow with similar tools

## Key Question

> "Are these companies the Kodaks of the AI era, or the Amazons who adapt?"

Thomson Reuters has been investing heavily in AI. Wolters Kluwer has AI products. The question is whether Anthropic's free/cheap plugins undercut their business model entirely or just force margin compression.

## What Would Change This View

- Companies show AI tools actually INCREASE usage (complement not substitute)
- Anthropic legal tool has quality/accuracy issues
- Enterprise adoption slower than feared
- Regulatory barriers to AI in legal work

- Bounce opportunities (oversold)
