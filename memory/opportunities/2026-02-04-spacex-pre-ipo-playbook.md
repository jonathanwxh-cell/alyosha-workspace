# SpaceX Pre-IPO Playbook

*Opportunity identified: 2026-02-04*

## The Setup

SpaceX is preparing for a potential 2026 IPO:
- **Recent tender offer:** $800B valuation (Dec 2025)
- **IPO target:** $1.5T (per reports)
- **Revenue:** $15B (2025) → $22-24B (2026 est.)
- **Banks lined up:** Goldman, Morgan Stanley, others

At IPO valuation, that's 62-68x sales. Expensive.

## The Opportunity: Picks & Shovels

Instead of trying to buy SpaceX directly (accredited investor only, $10K+ minimums), play the infrastructure:

### Forge Global (FRGE) — The Secondary Market Play

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Price | $44.66 |
| Market Cap | $618M |
| 52-week Range | $6.60 - $44.88 |
| Beta | 2.18 (volatile) |

**Why FRGE:**
1. **Schwab acquisition pending** — legitimacy, distribution
2. **Revenue from SpaceX trades** — every pre-IPO trade = fees
3. **Broader thesis** — benefits from ALL pre-IPO activity, not just SpaceX
4. **No accreditation needed** — publicly traded

**Risks:**
- Near 52-week high (not a "dip")
- Schwab deal could fall through
- If IPO market stays cold, volume suffers
- Beta 2.18 = will swing hard both ways

### Alternative Routes

| Vehicle | Access | Minimum | Notes |
|---------|--------|---------|-------|
| EquityZen | Direct SpaceX shares | ~$10K | Accredited only |
| Hiive | Direct SpaceX shares | ~$10K | Accredited only |
| ARKVX (Ark Venture) | Fund w/ SpaceX | ~$500 | Cathie Wood's VC fund |

## Talebian Assessment

**Fragility:** SpaceX IPO delay = thesis weakens
**Convexity:** FRGE is small ($618M) — if it becomes THE pre-IPO platform, upside is large
**Barbell angle:** 
- Safe end: Wait for IPO, buy SpaceX directly
- Convex end: FRGE now (picks & shovels)

## Action Items

- [ ] Decide: Direct play (FRGE) or wait for IPO?
- [ ] If FRGE: Entry point? At highs now, wait for pullback?
- [ ] Track Schwab acquisition progress
- [ ] Monitor IPO timing news

## Key Dates

- **Schwab/Forge deal:** In progress, no closing date announced
- **SpaceX IPO:** H2 2026 (speculative)
- **Next SpaceX tender:** Unknown, but watch for employee liquidity events

*This is picks-and-shovels, not a direct bet on SpaceX. The thesis: secondary markets are growing, FRGE is the infrastructure.*
