# Opportunity: Thomson Reuters Earnings Bounce Play
**Date:** 2026-02-04  
**Ticker:** TRI (NASDAQ)  
**Type:** Event-driven, mean reversion  
**Timeframe:** 1-5 days  
**Conviction:** MEDIUM

---

## The Setup

Thomson Reuters dropped **18% in one day** (Feb 3) on Anthropic legal tool news. Earnings are **tomorrow (Feb 5)**. Classic oversold + catalyst setup.

## Current State

| Metric | Value | Note |
|--------|-------|------|
| Price | $93.50 | Bouncing +1.7% today |
| 52-wk Range | $86 - $218 | Near 52-week LOW |
| Drop from Peak | -57% | From $218 to $93 |
| Volume | 3.1M | 2.5x average (heavy) |
| Beta | 0.30 | Low volatility name |
| Morgan Stanley PT | $165 | 76% upside |
| Earnings | Feb 5 | TOMORROW |

## Bull Case

1. **Oversold** — 18% one-day drop is extreme for a 0.30 beta stock
2. **AI fear > AI reality** — TRI has own AI product (CoCounsel), not defenseless
3. **Earnings catalyst** — Morgan Stanley expects "Q4 broadly in line with guidance"
4. **Analyst support** — Multiple firms maintaining ratings, PT $165
5. **Bounce started** — Already +1.7% today from lows
6. **Quality business** — Westlaw, legal research, sticky enterprise contracts

## Bear Case

1. **AI disruption real** — Anthropic legal tools ARE competitive
2. **Earnings might disappoint** — Forward guidance could be cut
3. **Catching falling knife** — Could drop more post-earnings
4. **Sector contagion** — All legal/data stocks under pressure

## The Trade

### Aggressive
- **Entry:** Now at ~$93-94
- **Target:** $105-110 (10-15% bounce)
- **Stop:** $86 (52-week low)
- **Risk/Reward:** ~1:2

### Conservative
- **Wait for earnings** — If they beat/maintain and stock pops, confirms thesis
- **Entry:** Post-earnings if reaction positive
- **Target:** $120 (retracement of panic)

## What Would Change View

**Bullish invalidated if:**
- Earnings miss significantly
- Forward guidance slashed
- Management admits AI competitive threat worse than expected
- Stock breaks $86 (52-week low)

**More bullish if:**
- Earnings beat + strong AI narrative from management
- CoCounsel adoption metrics shared
- Analyst upgrades post-call

## Catalyst Timeline

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| Feb 5 | **Earnings release** |
| Feb 5 | Earnings call |
| Feb 6 | Analyst reactions |
| Feb 19 | Wolters Kluwer earnings (peer) |
| Feb 20 | Relx earnings (peer) |

## Position Sizing

Given MEDIUM conviction and event risk:
- Small position if taking before earnings
- Add on positive earnings reaction
- Maximum 2-3% of portfolio

## Key Question

> "Is this a DeepSeek-style panic that reverses, or the start of a structural decline?"

Earnings will provide the answer. Management commentary on AI will be critical.
