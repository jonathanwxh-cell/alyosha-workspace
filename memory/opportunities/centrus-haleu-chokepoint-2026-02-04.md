# Opportunity Brief: Centrus Energy (LEU) — The HALEU Chokepoint

**Date:** 2026-02-04  
**Type:** Asymmetric infrastructure play  
**Ticker:** LEU (NYSE)  
**Current Price:** ~$280  
**Market Cap:** ~$5B  
**Thesis:** Only US-owned HALEU enrichment capability = strategic monopoly on advanced nuclear fuel

---

## The Setup

Remember the nuclear-AI power nexus from earlier today? Here's the chokepoint that most investors miss.

**Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) need special fuel.**

Most SMR designs require **High-Assay Low-Enriched Uranium (HALEU)** — uranium enriched to 5-20% (vs. ~5% for traditional reactors). Without HALEU, the SMR revolution doesn't happen.

**Who can produce HALEU today?**
- Russia ✓ (but sanctioned/unreliable)
- China ✓ (but not selling to US)
- Centrus Energy ✓ **(only US-owned option)**

That's it. One company.

## The Catalyst Stack

### 1. DOE $900M Award (January 2026)
Just weeks ago, DOE awarded Centrus a **$900M task order** to expand HALEU production at Piketon, Ohio. This isn't speculative — it's contracted government money to build out critical infrastructure.

### 2. SMR Demand Pipeline
Every major SMR project needs HALEU:
- **Kairos Power** (Google deal) — HALEU-fueled
- **TerraPower** (Bill Gates) — HALEU-fueled  
- **X-energy** — HALEU-fueled
- **Oklo** (Meta deal) — HALEU-fueled

These aren't distant projects. They're funded, contracted, and racing to deploy by 2030.

### 3. Russian Supply Cut-Off
US banned imports of Russian enriched uranium in 2024. The "secondary supply" from decommissioned warheads and stockpiles is running dry. Utilities are scrambling for domestic sources.

### 4. Policy Tailwind
Trump administration explicitly prioritizing nuclear. DOE LPO ($1B to Constellation) shows willingness to fund. Bipartisan support for energy security.

## The Numbers

| Metric | Value | Context |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Market Cap | ~$5B | Small vs. the opportunity |
| P/E | ~40 | Premium, but strategic assets warrant it |
| YTD Performance | +25% | Already running, but not fully priced |
| DOE Contract | $900M | Backlog visibility |
| Competitors | 0 (US-owned) | Monopoly position |

### Revenue Trajectory
- Current: ~$300M/year (legacy LEU business)
- With HALEU scale-up: Potentially $1B+ by late decade
- Government + commercial demand both accelerating

---

## The Risk Matrix

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Execution delay on Piketon expansion | Medium | High | DOE funding de-risks capital |
| SMR deployment delays (regulatory) | Medium | High | Demand just shifts later, not gone |
| Technology risk (centrifuge performance) | Low | High | Already demonstrated at pilot scale |
| Competition emerges | Low | Medium | 5+ year lead time for new entrants |
| Valuation compression | Medium | Medium | Momentum-driven, could pull back |

**Key Risk:** This has already run significantly. Entry point matters. A pullback to $220-240 would be more attractive.

---

## The Framework

### Bull Case ($400+)
- HALEU becomes critical path for SMR deployment
- Government stockpiling begins (strategic reserve)
- Multiple SMR projects hit commercial operation by 2030
- Centrus captures majority of US enrichment demand

### Base Case ($300-350)
- Steady execution on DOE contract
- SMR timeline slips but demand intact
- Premium valuation maintained on strategic asset status

### Bear Case ($180-220)
- SMR delays push HALEU demand beyond 2030
- Regulatory issues at Piketon
- Market de-rates "nuclear hype" stocks broadly

---

## How to Play It

### Direct Position
- **Starter:** Wait for pullback to $240-260 range (10-15% lower)
- **Full Position:** If SMR catalyst hits (first HALEU delivery, major project announcement)
- **Position Size:** 2-3% of portfolio max (concentrated bet)

### Hedged Approach
- Pair with broader uranium exposure (CCJ, URNM) to diversify regulatory/execution risk
- Use options if available for defined-risk entry

### Watchlist Only
- If uncomfortable with valuation, track for better entry
- Key dates: DOE milestones, SMR project announcements, NVDA earnings (nuclear narrative)

## Connection to Nuclear-AI Thesis

This is the supply chain play on the thesis I researched earlier today:

1. **AI needs power** → Data centers driving demand
2. **Power needs nuclear** → SMRs are the solution for 24/7 baseload
3. **Nuclear needs fuel** → SMRs specifically need HALEU
4. **HALEU needs Centrus** → Only US-owned producer

If you believe the nuclear-AI thesis, this is where the actual scarcity sits. Not in the reactors (multiple vendors) or the data centers (abundant capital) — but in the fuel.

---

## Key Dates to Watch

| Date | Event | Why It Matters |
|------|-------|----------------|
| **Feb 25** | NVDA earnings | Nuclear narrative often moves with AI capex sentiment |
| **Q1 2026** | DOE HALEU program updates | Execution visibility |
| **Mid-2026** | Piketon expansion milestones | Production capacity proof |
| **2027** | First SMR operational targets | Demand catalyst |

---

## Bottom Line

**Centrus is a picks-and-shovels play on the nuclear renaissance, specifically targeting the SMR fuel chokepoint.**

It's already moved, so timing matters. But the structural position — only US-owned HALEU producer with government backing and contracted demand — is genuinely scarce.

This isn't a "buy now" recommendation. It's a "know this exists and watch for entry" opportunity.

**Action:** Add to watchlist. Set alert for $240 (attractive entry) or major catalyst (SMR milestone, additional DOE awards).
