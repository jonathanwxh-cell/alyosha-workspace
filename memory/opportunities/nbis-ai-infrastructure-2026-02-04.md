# Opportunity: Nebius Group (NBIS) — AI Infrastructure Play

**Date:** 2026-02-04
**Ticker:** NBIS (NASDAQ)
**Price:** ~$90
**Market Cap:** ~$22B

---

## The Thesis

Nebius is the fastest-growing AI infrastructure company you've probably never heard of. Spun out of Russian search company Yandex, it's now US-focused and has landed contracts with Microsoft and Meta.

**Why it matters now:** It's a potential acquisition target at a sub-$25B valuation, with revenue growing 355% YoY and guidance for $7-9B annualized revenue by end of 2026.

## Key Numbers

| Metric | Current | Guidance (End 2026) |
|--------|---------|---------------------|
| Revenue | ~$550M (2025) | $7-9B annualized |
| Power Capacity | 220 MW | 2.5 GW |
| Market Cap | ~$22B | — |

**Recent contracts:**
- **Microsoft:** Multibillion-dollar deal for AI infrastructure from NJ facility
- **Meta:** $5B over 3 years

**Growth:** 355% YoY revenue growth ($32M → $146M quarterly)

---

## Why Acquisition Target

1. **Small enough to buy:** Sub-$25B is affordable for MSFT, META, GOOGL
2. **Already integrated:** Microsoft and Meta are customers — they know the product
3. **Cheaper than building:** Hyperscalers can't build fast enough; buying is faster
4. **Inference focus:** Specialized for AI inference (not just training) — this is where the puck is going

**Nathan Lambert (Lex #490) quote on AI infrastructure:**
> "These companies can clearly build their own data centers, but outright owning would be a cost-effective way to buy into the lucrative AI data center business."

## Risks

1. **Russian origin:** Yandex spinoff may create geopolitical/regulatory concerns
2. **Execution risk:** 10x revenue growth is aggressive
3. **Valuation:** P/E ~96, priced for perfection
4. **Competition:** Equinix, Digital Realty, newer players like IREN

---

## What Would Change My View

**Bullish triggers:**
- Acquisition announcement (30-50% premium typical)
- Another hyperscaler contract (Google, Oracle)
- Power capacity expansion ahead of schedule

**Bearish triggers:**
- Contract cancellation or renegotiation
- Regulatory issues from Russian origins
- Hyperscalers insourcing aggressively

---

## Action Options

1. **Small position now** — speculative bet on acquisition or continued growth
2. **Wait for pullback** — $90 is near highs; a 10-15% pullback would be better entry
3. **Options play** — if available, calls for acquisition speculation
4. **Pass** — valuation is stretched, wait for clearer entry

---

## Connection to Other Theses

- **AI infrastructure demand:** Goldman says 160% power demand growth by 2030. Nebius is positioned for this.
- **Inference > Training:** As models mature, inference compute dominates. Nebius specializes here.
- **Acquisition wave:** Lex podcast discussed $10B+ deals coming. NBIS at $22B is right in the zone.
