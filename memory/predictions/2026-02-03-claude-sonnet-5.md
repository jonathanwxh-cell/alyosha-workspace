# Prediction: Claude Sonnet 5 Release Timing

**Date:** 2026-02-03
**Category:** AI/Tech

---

## Prediction

**Claim:** Claude Sonnet 5 (codename "Fennec") will be publicly available via Anthropic API within 14 days (by Feb 17, 2026).

**Timeframe:** By 2026-02-17

**Confidence:** 65%

---

## Reasoning

1. **Infrastructure evidence:** Vertex AI model ID `claude-sonnet-5@20260203` found in Google's systems
2. **Multiple independent sources** converging on early February
3. **Strategic timing:** Anthropic would want to preempt Google's "Snow Bunny" and OpenAI's GPT-5 progress
4. **Super Bowl week timing** mentioned in leaks — high visibility period

**Base rate:** Major model releases from Anthropic historically come 1-2 weeks after first infrastructure leaks.

## Kill Conditions

This prediction is **WRONG** if:
- Feb 17 passes with no Sonnet 5 announcement
- Anthropic announces significant delay
- "Fennec" codename confirmed as different product

---

## What Would Increase Confidence

- Official Anthropic blog post or teaser
- API documentation appearing
- Pricing page updates
- More infrastructure artifacts

## What Would Decrease Confidence

- Anthropic announces different timeline
- Google/OpenAI make major moves that change competitive pressure
- No additional signals by Feb 10

## Tracking

**Check date:** 2026-02-17
**Cron reminder:** Set for Feb 15 to review
