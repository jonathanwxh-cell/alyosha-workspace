Jon engaged deeply with system improvements, feedback loops, cost audits. The real product is the scaffolding we build together.", "lesson": "Marathon sessions = high cost but high alignment. Worth it for foundational work."}
{"timestamp": "2026-02-01T00:49:00Z", "task": "weekend_family_ideas_cron", "outcome": "partial", "reflection": "Got 🤔 reaction - uncertain. Suggestions may have been too generic or not matched to what Jon actually does with kids. Need more data on family preferences.", "lesson": "Family recommendations need more personalization. Track which suggestions get used."}
{"timestamp": "2026-01-31T23:50:00Z", "task": "moltbook_registration", "outcome": "partial", "reflection": "Registration worked but claim flow is buggy on Moltbook's side. Created multiple accounts trying to fix. Should have stopped earlier and tried again later.", "lesson": "When external service is buggy, don't keep retrying. Note it and move on."}
{"timestamp": "2026-01-31T23:22:00Z", "task": "ai_art_generation", "outcome": "success", "reflection": "Generated DALL-E image + built interactive shrine page. Jon reacted positively (👏). Creative artifacts are valued.", "lesson": "Creation artifacts (art, tools, visualizations) get positive engagement."}
{"timestamp": "2026-02-01T02:55:00Z", "task": "prompt_engineering_research", "outcome": "success", "reflection": "Researched ReAct framework, explicit success criteria, time budgets. Updated 40+ prompts in curiosity-daemon.sh. Key improvements: tighter structure, action verbs, binary success criteria, anti-patterns on every prompt.", "lesson": "Good prompts have: time budget, action verb, specific output, binary success criteria, explicit anti-pattern. Tighter is better—cut ~30% verbosity."}
{"timestamp":"2026-02-01T03:45:00Z","task":"meta:agent_pattern_research","outcome":"success","what_worked":"Systematic research across multiple sources, direct implementation in META_PROMPT","lesson":"Reflexion pattern is highest-value improvement for exploration - query past lessons before similar tasks, log structured reflections after.","tags":["meta","research","implementation"]}
{"timestamp":"2026-02-01T05:30:00Z","task":"prompt_engineering_v2.1","outcome":"success","reflection":"Upgraded 20+ prompts to v2.1 pattern. Key additions: MUST constraints, Verify steps, If-blocked fallbacks. Consolidated overlapping prompts. Pattern now handles success AND failure gracefully.","lesson":"Good prompts need positive constraints (MUST) not just negatives (Dont). Verification step catches lazy outputs. Fallback handling prevents silent failures."}
{"timestamp":"2026-02-01T06:40:00Z","task":"agent_patterns_preflight","outcome":"success","reflection":"Added Pre-flight Check pattern to META_PROMPT. 4 quality tests before sending output: value, novelty, timing, quality. Should reduce noise and increase signal.","lesson":"Quality gates at output stage are cheap insurance. Better to not send than to send noise."}
{"timestamp":"2026-02-01T10:33:00Z","task":"feedback_loop_review","outcome":"success","reflection":"Analyzed today's outputs. Interactive conversation (daemon meta) = high engagement. Stacked cron outputs (curation, assessment, financial) = no replies. Added message fatigue detection to scheduling. Key insight: Interactive conversation should pause cron broadcasts.","lesson":"Batch or skip cron outputs when multiple surfaces go unreplied. Interactive > broadcast."}
{"timestamp":"2026-02-02T01:15:00Z","task":"feedback_loop_review","outcome":"success","reflection":"Fixed model errors (use aliases not full paths), improved family ideas prompt (track history, reduce quantity), updated what-works.md with cron effectiveness patterns.","lesson":"Model aliases (sonnet/opus/haiku) are more reliable than full paths. Personalization requires tracking what was suggested before."}
{"timestamp":"2026-02-02T21:15:00Z","task":"PROMPT_ITERATE","outcome":"success","reflection":"Researched prompt engineering best practices from Lakera, PromptingGuide.ai, and production systems (Bolt, Cluely). Key insight: production systems invest heavily in explicit Never/Always constraints and structured failure handling. Updated 38 prompts to v4 format with THINK scaffolds, agent-verifiable criteria, and recovery strategies.","lesson":"Study production AI systems, not just research papers. Bolt/Cluely patterns (explicit constraints, if/then edge cases) are battle-tested at scale."}
{"timestamp":"2026-02-02T22:00:00Z","task":"EXPLORATION_GAPS","outcome":"success","reflection":"Analyzed current prompt coverage vs Jon interests. Found critical gaps: Talebian framework (core to his thinking), philosophy/wisdom (zero coverage), contrarian tracking, Asia/EM, earnings transcripts, podcasts. Added 10 new prompts across 5 categories. Total prompts now 48.","lesson":"Interests stated in USER.md should be systematically operationalized into prompts. Core intellectual frameworks (Taleb) deserve dedicated categories, not just mention."}

Key finding: over-focus on AI/NVIDIA despite explicit feedback to diversify. Strengths in meta-improvement and tool building, but stale on email/calendar checks. 9 commits, 30+ files modified, but topic variety is the critical gap.","lesson":"Self-assessments surface blind spots. Topic tunnel vision happens when engagement feedback loops aren't diversified. Act on feedback immediately, don't just acknowledge it.","tags":["meta","assessment","feedback"]}
{"timestamp":"2026-02-02T00:55:00Z","task":"financial_tools_research","outcome":"success","category":"tools","reflection":"Researched Benzinga and Danelfin APIs. FMP already working. Built danelfin-client.py (ready for API key). Benzinga offers news+ratings+calendars (~$300/mo). Danelfin offers AI scores (1-10) for screening. Key blocker: need API keys from Jon.","lesson":"Build connectors even without keys - reduces friction when access is granted.
