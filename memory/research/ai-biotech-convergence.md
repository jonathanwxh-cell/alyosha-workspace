# AI + Biotech Convergence: Research Brief

*Created: 2026-01-31 | Last updated: 2026-01-31*

## 🔬 This Week's Breakthrough: AI-Designed Tumor-Targeting Proteins

**Source:** Stanford + Lawrence Berkeley Lab (Jan 2025)
**Paper:** Householder et al. (Stanford School of Medicine)

### What happened
Stanford researchers used generative AI to design a new class of tumor-targeting proteins (TCR mimics) that:
- **2,600 novel designs generated in 30 hours**
- Promising candidates identified in **<2 weeks** (vs years by traditional methods)
- High specificity = minimal off-target effects
- Validated at atomic scale using protein crystallography

### Why it matters
1. **Speed:** Drug candidate discovery compressed from years → weeks
2. **Precision:** AI-designed proteins show tighter, more selective binding than traditional approaches
3. **Platform potential:** Could enable personalized cancer therapies where tumor peptide sequences guide therapeutic engineering

### Technical insight
They constrained design space to α-helical proteins (more rigid scaffold) → reduced flexibility = better computational accuracy + fewer off-target effects. Smart constraint = better outcomes.

## 💰 Investment Landscape: AI + Drug Discovery

### Public Companies

| Company | Ticker | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| **Recursion Pharmaceuticals** | RXRX | NVIDIA-backed (BioHive-2 supercomputer), partners with Sanofi/Roche/Genentech. Clinical stage. "Inflection point" per analysts. |
| **Eli Lilly** | LLY | Just announced $1B AI co-innovation lab with NVIDIA |
| **NVIDIA** | NVDA | Infrastructure play - powers most AI biotech platforms |

### Private/Watchlist

| Company | Funding | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| **Charm Therapeutics** | $80M (Sept 2025) | UK-based, NVIDIA-backed, protein design |
| **CuspAI** | $100M (Sept 2025) | UK-based, AI materials discovery, NVIDIA-backed |

### Investment Thesis
AI-biotech convergence is accelerating. Key dynamics:
- Traditional drug discovery: 10+ years, $1B+ per drug
- AI-assisted: Could cut both by 50-70%
- Infrastructure winners (NVIDIA) vs picks-and-shovels vs clinical risk takers (RXRX)

## 🔗 Cross-Domain Connections

1. **AlphaFold impact:** Paper cited 43,000+ times as of Nov 2025. Protein structure prediction opened the door for this kind of design work.

2. **Intel neuromorphic angle:** Hala Point cluster showing 100x less power than CPUs for AI workloads. If biotech AI becomes compute-constrained, neuromorphic could matter.

3. **China competition:** Stanford analysis shows >50% of researchers in key breakthroughs never left China for schooling/work. US talent lead assumption challenged.
