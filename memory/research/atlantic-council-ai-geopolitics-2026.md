# Analysis: Eight Ways AI Will Shape Geopolitics in 2026
**Source:** Atlantic Council  
**Analyzed:** 2026-02-02  
**Mental Models Applied:** Second-order effects, Competitive dynamics, Information asymmetry

## Executive Summary

Eight expert predictions clustered into **3 meta-themes**:
1. **Information Integrity Crisis** (AI poisoning, influence ops, judgment erosion)
2. **Tech Stack Wars** (US vs China export strategy, sovereign AI)
3. **Governance Fragmentation** (global form, geopolitical substance)

## Key Predictions Matrix

| Trend | Probability | Impact | Investment Relevance |
|-------|-------------|--------|---------------------|
| AI poisoning goes mainstream | HIGH | HIGH | Cybersecurity, verification tools |
| US pushes tech exports | HIGH | MEDIUM | NVDA, US cloud (MSFT/AMZN/GOOG) |
| China doubles down on open-source | HIGH | HIGH | Shifts moat dynamics |
| Sovereign AI race | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | Regional cloud, local chips |
| Global governance = fragmented | HIGH | LOW | Regulatory arbitrage persists |
| Middle powers close gap (India) | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | India tech plays |

## Mental Model Analysis

### 1. Second-Order Effects (Talebian lens)

**First-order:** Russia poisons AI training data  
**Second-order:** 
- Trust in AI outputs erodes → humans verify more → slower adoption in high-stakes domains
- "Clean data" becomes scarce resource → premium pricing → new market emerges
- **Actionable:** Data provenance/verification companies = potential opportunity

**First-order:** US exports H200 chips to China  
**Second-order:**
- China gets training compute → accelerates models → competes on open-source
- US lock-in strategy may backfire if China open-source wins hearts/minds
- **Actionable:** Watch for open-source model adoption metrics

### 2. Competitive Dynamics

```
US Strategy: "If the world uses our stack, we win"
 └─ Exports hardware + cloud + standards
 └─ Risk: Commoditizes hardware faster

China Strategy: "Free + applied > expensive + general"
 └─ Open-source models + deployment-ready
 └─ Advantage: No export restrictions, price competitive

Wild card: DeepSeek new training method (Jan 2026)
 └─ Efficient scaling = cost advantage
 └─ Could accelerate China's open-source lead
```

### 3. Information Asymmetry

**AI Poisoning Dynamics:**
- ~2 year lag in training data
- Campaigns from 2024 manifesting NOW
- Cannot audit deployed models
- **Implication:** Epistemic crisis accelerates

## Actionable Insights

### For Portfolio
1. **Cybersecurity/data integrity** plays may benefit (verification tools, clean data)
2. **India AI investments** accelerating (US giants pledging billions)
3. **Open-source competition** threatens closed-model moats (watch Anthropic, OpenAI vs DeepSeek)

### For Mental Model
1. **Don't assume US chip dominance = AI dominance** — open-source can route around hardware
2. **Information environment degrading** — factor AI poisoning into research confidence
3. **Governance won't solve it** — expect continued fragmentation, arbitrage opportunities

### Watch List
- DeepSeek model releases (follow-up to Jan paper)
- India AI investment announcements
- US-China rare earth tensions (Venezuela, Colombia)
- AI poisoning detection tools/research

## Confidence Assessment

| Claim | My Confidence | Reasoning |
|-------|---------------|-----------|
| AI poisoning is real threat | ⭐⭐⭐ | Anthropic + AISI research cited |
| China open-source will gain share | ⭐⭐⭐ | Economic logic + early evidence |
| US export strategy wins | ⭐⭐ | Contested, depends on execution |
| Global governance effective | ⭐ | Track record poor |
