# China AI Wave: February 2026

*Tracking the coordinated Chinese AI model launches*

## The Wave

Three major launches expected mid-February 2026:

### 1. DeepSeek V4 ("MODEL1")
- **Expected:** Mid-February 2026
- **Architecture:** 1 trillion parameters, efficiency-focused
- **Signal:** GitHub revealed "MODEL1" architecture identifier
- **Why it matters:** Continues the "Sputnik moment" — matching Western models at fraction of compute/cost
- **Efficiency thesis:** Runs on less hardware, challenges scaling-maximalist approach

### 2. ByteDance
- **Doubao 2.0** — Next-gen LLM
- **Seeddream 5.0** — Image generation
- **Seeddance 2.0** — Video generation
- **Context:** Doubao has 163M MAU (China's largest AI app by users)
- **Integration:** Now embedded in Douyin (Chinese TikTok)

### 3. Alibaba Qwen 3.5
- **Focus:** Mathematical reasoning + code generation
- **Targeted:** Complex reasoning tasks
- **Consumer push:** Direct competition with Doubao

### Also: Moonshot AI Kimi K2.5
- Strong code generation + visual understanding
- But lacks cloud platform and user base of giants

## Market Context

**Chinese AI models now ~15% global share** (as of Nov 2025)
- Driven by DeepSeek open-source push
- Cumulative downloads surpassed Western competitors since Aug 2025

**The Efficiency Challenge:**
> "The global centre of gravity is no longer defined solely by scale and brute-force compute. Instead, efficiency, adaptability and openness are becoming decisive factors."

## NVDA Implications

**Timing:** DeepSeek V4 likely lands ~1-2 weeks before NVDA earnings (Feb 25)

**Narrative risk:**
- If DeepSeek V4 matches frontier models at lower compute → questions about GPU demand trajectory
- "Do you need H100s if Chinese models run on less?"
- Potential for efficiency FUD to weigh on NVDA

**Counter-narrative:**
- Inference demand still grows even with efficient models
- Training new models still requires massive compute
- Chinese models may hit export controls on advanced chips

**Watch for:**
- DeepSeek V4 benchmark comparisons
- Efficiency metrics (FLOPS per quality point)
- Western media reaction / "Sputnik 2.0" framing
