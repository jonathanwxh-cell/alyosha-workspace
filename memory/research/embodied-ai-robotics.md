## 🎯 The Thesis

**2026 is the year AI moves from digital to physical.**

The paradigm shift: from predicting the next *word* to predicting the next *state of the world* (Next-State Prediction). This enables robots that understand physics, causality, and real-world dynamics.

Key signal: **ReconVLA won AAAI Outstanding Paper Award** — first embodied intelligence project to win at a top AI conference. The breakthrough: solving the "attention problem" in Vision-Language-Action models so robots can reliably focus on the right objects in cluttered scenes.

## 💰 Key Players & Valuations

### Tier 1: Platform Plays

| Company | Valuation | Total Raised | Focus | Key Backers |
|---------|-----------|--------------|-------|-------------|
| **Skild AI** | $14B+ | ~$2B | "Universal brain" - foundation models for any robot | SoftBank, NVIDIA, Bezos, LG, Samsung |
| **Figure AI** | $39B | $1.9B+ | Humanoid robots (Figure 01, 02, 03) | Intel, Microsoft, NVIDIA, OpenAI |

### Tier 2: Vertical Specialists

| Company | Focus | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| **1X Technologies** | NEO humanoid, consumer | OpenAI partnership |
| **Fourier Intelligence** | GR-1 humanoid | Mass production target 2026 |
| **Boston Dynamics** | Industrial/military | Hyundai subsidiary |
| **Tesla Optimus** | Manufacturing, consumer | Integrated with Tesla factories |

### Infrastructure Enablers

| Company | Role |
|---------|------|
| **NVIDIA** | Omniverse simulation, Isaac SDK, compute |
| **Arm** | Chip architecture (SoftBank) |
| **ABB Robotics** | Industrial arms + "Embodied Intelligence Lab" with AsiaInfo |

## 📈 Valuation Trajectory

**Skild AI:**
- Series A (2024): $1.5B valuation, Bezos-backed
- Series B (May 2025): $4.7B, SoftBank led
- Series C (Jan 2026): $14B+, nearly 3x in 8 months

**Figure AI:**
- Feb 2024: $2.6B
- Sep 2025: $39B (15x in 18 months)

→ Market is pricing in winner-take-most dynamics for "robot brains"

## 🔑 Investment Angles

### 1. Pick-and-Shovel: NVIDIA
Already deep in robotics stack (simulation, training, inference). Every robotics company is a customer.

### 2. Platform Bet: Skild AI (private)
"Universal brain" thesis = one foundation model for all robots. If it works, massive TAM. High risk, highest potential reward.

### 3. Integrated Play: Figure AI (private)
Building hardware + software together. More capital-intensive but controls full stack.

### 4. Proxy Plays
- **SoftBank (9984.T)**: Major Skild backer, owns Arm
- **Samsung**: Skild investor, manufacturing capability
- **Hyundai**: Owns Boston Dynamics

### 5. China Watch
- Fourier Intelligence, Unitree targeting mass production
- Lower manufacturing costs = margin pressure on US players
- Government support for robotics development

## ⚠️ Key Risks

1. **Humanoid hype cycle**: Lab demos ≠ production reliability
2. **Unit economics unclear**: Figure 01 estimated $30K-$150K per unit
3. **Regulatory uncertainty**: Labor displacement concerns
4. **China competition**: Cost advantage in manufacturing
5. **Integration challenges**: Software brains need to work with diverse hardware

## 🔮 Catalysts to Watch

| Event | Timing | Impact |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Figure AI factory deployment results | Q1-Q2 2026 | Proof of commercial viability |
| Skild AI pilot project outcomes | 2026 | Validates "universal brain" thesis |
| Tesla Optimus production numbers | 2026 | Mass market signal |
| First major humanoid IPO | 2026-2027? | Public market validation |
| Regulatory frameworks (US, EU, China) | Ongoing | Risk/opportunity |

## 📊 Market Size Estimates

- **ABI Research**: Predicts inflection point 2026-2027 as ROI hurdles clear
- **Humanoid robot market**: $16.7B surge expected (WebProNews)
- **"Digital blue-collar"**: Factory → household → caregiving progression

---

## 🧠 Technical Concepts

**Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models**: The core architecture connecting perception → reasoning → physical action

**Next-State Prediction (NSP)**: Predicting world state changes, not just next tokens. Enables understanding of physics and causality.

**ReconVLA breakthrough**: Solved implicit target localization — robots can now focus on relevant objects in cluttered scenes

## Notes

*Add observations, questions, updates here:*

- Q: Is Skild's "universal brain" defensible or will frontier labs (OpenAI, Anthropic) move into this?
- Q: What's the NVIDIA strategy — invest in all players, let them compete?
- Watch: ABB + AsiaInfo "Embodied Intelligence Lab" — Asia industrial adoption signal
