# SpaceX IPO Watch

*Created: 2026-01-31 | Tracking potential largest IPO in history*

---

## The Headlines

**SpaceX is considering a June 2026 IPO at ~$1.5 TRILLION valuation**

- Target raise: **$50 billion** (would be largest IPO ever, beating Saudi Aramco's $29.4B)
- Timing: Mid-June 2026 (reportedly timed to align with Musk's birthday + "the planets")
- Recent financials: **$8 billion profit in 2025** (Reuters exclusive)
- Some banks estimate valuation could exceed $1.5T based on financials

## Why This Matters

1. **Market event of the decade** — A $1.5T IPO would dwarf everything before it
2. **Retail access to SpaceX** — First time public can directly invest
3. **Starlink monetization** — Bulk of value is in Starlink, now profitable
4. **Index inclusion** — Would immediately enter S&P 500, forcing passive buying
5. **Musk liquidity event** — Could fund other ventures (xAI, Neuralink, Tesla)

## Valuation Context

| Company | Market Cap | Notes |
|---------|------------|-------|
| Apple | ~$3.8T | Largest public company |
| NVIDIA | ~$4.0T | First to $4T (July 2025) |
| SpaceX (private) | $350B | Dec 2024 tender |
| SpaceX (IPO target) | $1.5T | 4x in 18 months |

## Business Segments

### Starlink (Satellite Internet)
- ~5 million subscribers (est.)
- $100+/month ARPU
- Now profitable
- Expanding to airlines, maritime, enterprise
- Competitor moats: 6,000+ satellites in orbit

### Launch Services
- Falcon 9: Workhorse, ~100 launches/year
- Falcon Heavy: Heavy lift
- Starship: Next-gen, fully reusable (testing)

### Starship
- Key to Mars mission, lunar landers
- NASA HLS contract ($2.9B)
- If successful, transforms economics of space

## Timeline & Catalysts

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| Jan 28, 2026 | FT reports IPO discussions |
| Jan 30, 2026 | Reuters: $8B 2025 profit confirmed |
| Q1 2026 | Likely: Bank selection, S-1 preparation |
| June 2026 | Target IPO window |
| Post-IPO | S&P 500 inclusion (60-90 days typical) |

## Investment Angles

### Pre-IPO
- **Secondary markets**: Forge Global, EquityZen (accredited investors)
- **Proxy plays**: Suppliers, partners (harder to identify pure plays)

### Post-IPO
- Direct purchase
- Wait for index inclusion dip (funds front-run, then sell)
- Options strategies once available

### Related Plays
- **Rocket Lab (RKLB)**: Small launch competitor, valuation comparison
- **AST SpaceMobile (ASTS)**: Satellite competitor
- **Iridium (IRDM)**: Legacy satellite comms

## Risks

1. **Musk changes mind** — He's historically preferred SpaceX private
2. **Market conditions** — June 2026 could be volatile
3. **Valuation reset** — $1.5T may not hold in public markets
4. **Starship delays** — Execution risk on next-gen launch
5. **Competition** — Blue Origin, China, Rocket Lab scaling

## Key Questions

- Will Starlink spin off separately or stay bundled?
- What % of company will be offered (likely small)?
- Dual-class shares (Musk control)?
- Lock-up period for insiders?
