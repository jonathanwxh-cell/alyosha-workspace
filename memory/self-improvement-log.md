**Action:** INITIALIZE
**Target:** Cron Auto-Tuner
**Reason:** Implemented closed-loop self-improvement mechanism
**Result:** `scripts/cron-autotuner.py` created, wired to weekly-self-review

**Mechanism:**
1. Track engagement per cron topic in `feedback-log.jsonl`
2. After 3+ runs with 0% engagement → auto-disable cron
3. After 3+ runs with >50% engagement → flag for frequency boost
4. All changes logged here automatically

**Next:** Improve engagement tracking to capture replies/reactions properly.
