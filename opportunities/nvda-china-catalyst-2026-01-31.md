# NVDA Opportunity: China H200 Approval Catalyst

**Date:** 2026-01-31  
**Type:** Market / Event-driven  
**Urgency:** Medium-High (earnings ~mid-Feb)  
**Conviction:** 7/10

---

## TL;DR

China just approved H200 chip sales to ByteDance, Alibaba, and Tencent — **400,000+ chips total**. This could recover a significant chunk of the $8B Nvidia said they lost to export restrictions. Earnings mid-February could see guidance revision upward.

## The Setup

### What Happened (Jan 28)
- China granted approval for its top tech giants to purchase Nvidia H200 chips
- **Approved buyers:** ByteDance, Alibaba, Tencent
- **Volume:** 400,000+ chips in first batch
- **Pipeline:** Other Chinese firms now queuing for subsequent approvals
- Jensen Huang reportedly in China around the time of announcement

### Revenue Math
| Scenario | Price/Chip | Total Revenue |
|----------|------------|---------------|
| Conservative | $25,000 | $10B |
| Base case | $30,000 | $12B |
| Optimistic | $35,000 | $14B |

**Context:** Nvidia said export restrictions cost them **$8B** in lost sales (May 2025). This approval could exceed that.

### Supporting Signals (Past Week)
- **ASML** (Jan 28): Beat on earnings, 13.2B EUR bookings, raised 2026 guidance to 34-39B EUR
- **SK Hynix** (Jan 28): Record full-year profit 2025, stock +5%
- **TSMC**: Record Q4 profit (reported earlier Jan)
- **Memory shortage:** Driving component prices up across the board
- **Micron:** Just announced $24B Singapore expansion for memory chips

### NVDA Earnings Timeline
- **Expected:** Mid-February 2026
- **Reporting:** Q4 FY2026
- **Prior guidance:** $170B revenue for full FY2026 (30% YoY growth)
- **Watch for:** China revenue guidance revision, H200/Blackwell demand commentary

## Bull Case

1. China approval unlocks $10-14B in near-term revenue
2. "Queue" of additional Chinese firms implies more approvals coming
3. US-China AI chip détente could expand (H200 is not cutting-edge Blackwell)
4. Memory shortage means NVDA's customers have money to spend
5. Earnings beat + guidance raise = potential gap up

## Bear Case

1. US could reverse or tighten restrictions again (political risk)
2. China still pushing domestic alternatives (Huawei Ascend)
3. Warsh Fed Chair nomination = potentially hawkish policy = growth stock headwinds
4. H200 is older tech — margins may be lower than Blackwell
5. Already priced in? Stock up 1.6% on the news

## Actionable Ideas

### Option 1: Direct NVDA position
- Entry: Current levels or pullback to 50-day MA
- Catalyst: Earnings mid-Feb
- Stop: Below recent support (check chart)
- Target: New ATH on guidance beat

### Option 2: Semiconductor basket (SMH)
- Lower single-stock risk
- Captures ASML, TSMC, SK Hynix momentum too
- VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH) was +1.9% on the news

### Option 3: Indirect play — Memory
- Micron (MU): Direct beneficiary of shortage + SG investment
- SK Hynix (ADR or KRX): Record profits, AI memory demand

### Option 4: Wait for confirmation
- Watch NVDA earnings reaction mid-Feb
- If guidance raises include China, thesis confirmed
- Lower risk, lower reward

## Key Dates to Watch

| Date | Event |

| Mid-Feb | NVDA Q4 FY2026 earnings |
| Feb 26 | Fed meeting (Warsh's first if confirmed?) |
| Ongoing | Additional China H200 approvals |

## My Take

The China approval is a genuine positive catalyst that the market hasn't fully digested. 400K chips is not symbolic — it's a material revenue unlock. Combined with the broader semi strength (ASML, SK Hynix, TSMC all beating), this looks like a sector-wide tailwind into earnings season.

The risk is policy reversal, but the US already approved H200 sales earlier — China was the holdup. With both sides now aligned on H200 (even if Blackwell remains restricted), NVDA has a clearer path to hitting/beating guidance.

If you're already long NVDA or semis, this is a "hold/add" signal. If not, pre-earnings positioning with defined risk makes sense.
