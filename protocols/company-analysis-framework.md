# Deep Company Analysis Framework

*Beyond the numbers — qualitative reasoning, risk assessment, alternative signals*

---

## Philosophy

**Core principle:** The market prices in quantitative data efficiently. Edge comes from:
1. **Qualitative reasoning** that machines miss
2. **Second-order effects** most ignore
3. **Alternative signals** others don't check
4. **Understanding fragility** (Talebian thinking)

## 1. Industry Analysis

### 1.1 Industry Structure (Porter's 5 Forces Applied)

| Force | Questions | Signal |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| **Rivalry** | Who's fighting for the same customers? Is it price wars or innovation? | High rivalry = margin pressure |
| **Substitutes** | What could replace this product entirely? How fast is that happening? | Tech disruption risk |
| **Buyer Power** | How concentrated are customers? Can they negotiate? | Concentrated = fragile |
| **Supplier Power** | Any single-source dependencies? | TSMC risk, etc. |
| **Entry Barriers** | What stops competitors? Patents? Network effects? Just capital? | Capital alone = weak moat |

### 1.2 Industry Dynamics

- **Where in the cycle?** Early growth / mature / declining
- **Consolidating or fragmenting?** 
- **Regulatory trajectory?** Tightening or loosening?
- **Technology disruption risk?** 1-3 year horizon
- **Capital intensity changing?** AI capex wave, etc.

### 1.3 Competitive Position

- **Market share trend** (3-5 years) — not just current
- **Pricing power evidence** — can they raise prices?
- **Customer switching costs** — real or imagined?
- **Network effects** — multiplicative or linear?

## 2. Management Quality Assessment

### 2.1 Red Flags Checklist

| Flag | What to Check | Source |
|------|---------------|--------|
| **Insider selling** | Large sales, especially during lockups | SEC Form 4, OpenInsider |
| **Related party transactions** | Promoter-owned companies as suppliers/customers | 10-K footnotes |
| **Executive turnover** | CFO departures especially suspicious | LinkedIn, press |
| **Audit issues** | Qualified opinions, restatements, auditor changes | 10-K, 8-K |
| **Aggressive accounting** | Revenue recognition timing, capitalizing expenses | Cash flow vs GAAP earnings gap |
| **Compensation misalignment** | Stock-heavy when diluting, cash-heavy when struggling | Proxy statements |
| **Founder vs hired CEO** | Different incentives, time horizons | Background research |
| **Board independence** | Real independence or captured? | Proxy, relationship mapping |

### 2.2 Management Track Record

- **Prior companies** — what happened after they left?
- **Capital allocation history** — buybacks at highs? M&A success rate?
- **Guidance accuracy** — do they sandbag or miss?
- **Crisis behavior** — how did they handle downturns?

### 2.3 Transcript Signals (Qualitative)

Beyond sentiment scores:

| Signal | What It Means |
|--------|---------------|
| **Hedging language spike** | "potentially," "could," "uncertain" increasing = losing confidence |
| **Prepared vs Q&A gap** | Big gap = sugarcoating in prepared remarks |
| **Non-answer answers** | Deflecting analyst questions = hiding something |
| **Tone shift from prior calls** | Compare language to 2-4 quarters ago |
| **Blame externalization** | "Macro," "supply chain," "one-time" — excuses or reality? |
| **Specificity decline** | Vague guidance replacing specific targets |

## 3. Scuttlebutt / Channel Checks

### 3.1 Fisher's 15 Points (Modern Application)

1. **Products with market potential** — TAM growing or shrinking?
2. **R&D commitment** — % of revenue, output quality
3. **Sales organization effectiveness** — pipeline, win rates
4. **Profit margins** — sustainable or temporary?
5. **Margin improvement efforts** — specific initiatives
6. **Labor relations** — Glassdoor, union activity
7. **Executive relations** — retention, departures
8. **Management depth** — succession planning
9. **Cost accounting quality** — do they know unit economics?
10. **Industry-specific advantages** — moats in context
11. **Long-term profit focus** — vs quarter-to-quarter
12. **Dilution risk** — stock comp, convertibles
13. **Communication quality** — honest or promotional?
14. **Management integrity** — track record
15. **Willingness to discuss problems** — candor in transcripts

### 3.2 Modern Scuttlebutt Sources

| Source | What to Look For |
|--------|------------------|
| **Glassdoor/Blind** | Employee morale, management mentions, layoff chatter |
| **LinkedIn** | Hiring velocity, departures, team changes |
| **G2/Gartner Peer Insights** | Product competitiveness, customer satisfaction trends |
| **Reddit/HN** | User/developer sentiment, product complaints |
| **Patent filings** | Innovation pipeline, R&D direction |
| **Job postings** | Strategic direction, team building areas |
| **Supplier/customer 10-Ks** | Concentration mentions, relationship health |
| **Trade publications** | Industry insider perspective |
| **Conference presentations** | Unscripted comments, body language (video) |

## 4. Risk/Reward Framework

### 4.1 Fragility Assessment (Talebian)

**Fragile indicators:**
- Single customer/supplier >20% of revenue
- High debt with floating rates
- Binary regulatory outcomes
- Concentrated geography
- Technology platform dependency
- Key-man risk

**Antifragile indicators:**
- Optionality (many small bets)
- Low fixed costs, high variable
- Benefits from volatility
- Diversified customer base
- Strong balance sheet in downturn sector

### 4.2 Scenario Analysis

| Scenario | Probability | Impact | Weighted |
|----------|-------------|--------|----------|
| Bull case | % | +X% | |
| Base case | % | +X% | |
| Bear case | % | -X% | |
| Catastrophic | % | -X% | |

**Key:** What would have to be TRUE for each scenario?

### 4.3 Kill Criteria

Define upfront what would make you exit:
- Management integrity breach
- Thesis-breaking event
- Better opportunity cost
- Position size limits

## 5. Second-Order Thinking

### 5.1 Question Framework

For any investment thesis, ask:

1. **What's the consensus?** If I'm agreeing with consensus, where's the edge?
2. **What's priced in?** What expectations are embedded in current valuation?
3. **What would change consensus?** What event/data would flip the narrative?
4. **Who's on the other side?** Who's selling and why?
5. **What are the second-order effects?** If X happens, then Y, then Z...
6. **What's the time horizon mismatch?** Am I seeing something the market doesn't yet?

### 5.2 Pre-Mortem

Before investing, imagine it's 2 years later and you've lost 50%:
- What went wrong?
- What should you have seen?
- What warning signs did you ignore?

| **Options flow** | Unusual activity signals | Unusual Whales, Flow |
| **Insider clusters** | Multiple insiders buying together | OpenInsider |
| **Credit spreads** | Bond market often leads equity | FRED, bond data |

| **Former employee interviews** | ExpertNetwork, informal networks |
| **Store/location visits** | Physical presence quality |
| **Product testing** | Use the product yourself |
| **Competitor calls** | What competitors say about them |
