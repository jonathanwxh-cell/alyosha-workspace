# Curation Protocol

**MANDATORY before recommending any content to Jon.**

## Checklist (must complete ALL)

### 1. Source
- [ ] Fetched and READ the actual content (not just search snippet)
- [ ] Verified source credibility (who wrote it? what's their angle?)
- [ ] Checked publication date (is it stale?)

### 2. Comprehension
- [ ] Can I explain the core argument in one sentence?
- [ ] What's the non-obvious insight? (If I can't find one, don't recommend)
- [ ] What does the author get wrong or oversimplify?

### 3. Analysis
- [ ] Applied relevant mental model (Taleb, second-order thinking, incentive analysis)
- [ ] Cross-referenced with other sources or prior knowledge
- [ ] Identified investment/actionable angle if relevant

### 4. Presentation
- [ ] Key insight FIRST (not background)
- [ ] Confidence rating (⭐ to ⭐⭐⭐) with reasoning
- [ ] What would change my assessment?

## Anti-Patterns (DO NOT)

❌ Recommend based on title/snippet alone
❌ Summarize without analysis
❌ Include filler content to pad the list
❌ Say "interesting" without explaining WHY

## Quality Bar

Ask: "Would Jon learn something he couldn't get from scanning headlines himself?"

If no → don't include it.
