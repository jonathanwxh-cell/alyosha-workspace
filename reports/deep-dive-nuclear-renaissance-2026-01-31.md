# The Nuclear Renaissance: AI's Unlikely Power Play

*Deep Dive | January 31, 2026*

---

## The Thesis in 60 Seconds

Big tech needs power. A lot of it. Data centers will consume **1,300 TWh by 2035** — nearly 3x today's 460 TWh. The grid can't keep up. Renewables are intermittent. Natural gas faces carbon constraints. 

Nuclear is the only scalable, 24/7, carbon-free baseload option. In the past 12 months, hyperscalers signed contracts for **10+ gigawatts** of new nuclear capacity. This isn't ESG theater — it's infrastructure math.

The investment question: Is this the beginning of a multi-decade buildout, or a hype cycle that crashes on execution?

## Part 1: The Deals That Changed Everything

### Microsoft: Three Mile Island Returns

**The irony is thick.** Fifty years after America's worst nuclear accident, Microsoft is spending **$16 billion over 20 years** to restart the same site.

- **Capacity:** 835 MW (100% to Microsoft)
- **Target restart:** 2028
- **Partner:** Constellation Energy
- **Renamed:** Crane Clean Energy Center

The reactor restarting wasn't involved in the 1979 accident. Constellation shut it down in 2019 due to operating losses. Microsoft's commitment provides the revenue certainty to justify $1.6B+ restart investment.

**Signal:** When Microsoft takes a 20-year position on nuclear (vs. typical 10-year solar/wind PPAs), something fundamental has shifted.

### Google: First Corporate SMR Fleet Deal

**Historic:** Google and Kairos Power signed the first corporate agreement to develop a Small Modular Reactor fleet in the US.

- **Capacity:** Up to 500 MW across 6-7 reactors
- **First reactor:** 2030 (Hermes 2, 50 MW)
- **Full deployment:** Through 2035
- **Grid partner:** Tennessee Valley Authority

Kairos uses a **molten-salt cooling system** with ceramic pebble-type fuel — fundamentally different from conventional reactors. Received NRC construction permit Nov 2024.

**Risk allocation:** Kairos and Google bear first-of-a-kind costs. TVA provides revenue via PPA. Consumers don't carry development risk.

### Amazon: The $20 Billion Bet

- Acquired Talen Energy's campus next to **Susquehanna nuclear plant** (Pennsylvania)
- Expanding to **15 data center buildings** on 1,600 acres
- Total investment: **$20B+** for nuclear-powered AI campus
- Backed **5 GW of X-energy SMR projects** (Oct 2024)

Amazon isn't waiting for new nuclear — they're buying real estate next to existing plants while funding the next generation.

### Meta: 1-4 GW RFP

Meta issued an RFP seeking **1-4 gigawatts** of new nuclear (both SMRs and large reactors), targeting early 2030s. Already signed PPA with Constellation for existing Illinois nuclear capacity.

**The Meta deal ripple:** When announced, nuclear stocks surged across the board. The "Meta effect" demonstrated how single announcements move the entire sector.

### Oracle: The Gigawatt SMR Campus

Larry Ellison announced plans for a **1 GW+ data center powered by three SMRs**. Claims building permits already secured. Would exceed Oracle's current largest facility (800 MW of NVIDIA clusters).

## Part 2: The Math That Forces the Bet

### Power Demand Explosion

| Year | Data Center Electricity (TWh) | Growth |
|------|------------------------------|--------|
| 2024 | 460 | — |
| 2030 | 1,000+ | 2.2x |
| 2035 | 1,300+ | 2.8x |

**US-specific:** Data center demand could hit **100-130 GW by 2030**, leaving an **80 GW shortfall** vs. current grid capacity.

### Why Nuclear Wins the Baseload Math

| Source | Capacity Factor | Carbon | 24/7? | Scalable? |
|--------|----------------|--------|-------|-----------|
| Nuclear | 90%+ | Zero | ✅ | ✅ (with time) |
| Solar | 25-30% | Zero | ❌ | ✅ |
| Wind | 30-40% | Zero | ❌ | ✅ |
| Natural Gas | 85%+ | High | ✅ | ✅ |
| Hydro | 40-50% | Zero | ❌ | Limited |

**The constraint:** AI workloads need consistent power. A 1 GW AI training cluster can't tolerate intermittency. Nuclear provides the baseload that renewables cannot.

### Current Mix (US Data Centers)

- Natural Gas: **40%+**
- Renewables: **24%**
- Coal: **15%**
- Nuclear: **15-20%**

Nuclear share expected stable through 2030, then growing as SMRs deploy.

## Part 3: The SMR Revolution (And Its Skeptics)

### What Are SMRs?

Small Modular Reactors: **<300 MW** capacity (vs. 1,000+ MW traditional plants), factory-built modules, faster deployment, smaller footprint.

**Key players:**
- **NuScale (SMR)** — Only NRC-certified design in US. 462 MW US 460 approved May 2025.
- **Kairos Power** — Molten salt coolant. Google partner.
- **X-energy** — Amazon-backed. Pebble-bed design.
- **Oklo (OKLO)** — Sam Altman-chaired. Micro-reactors.

### Policy Tailwinds

**Trump's Nuclear Executive Orders (May 2025):**
- Executive Order 14300: Aggressive new licensing deadlines
- Four orders total focused on SMR deployment
- NuScale approval came **2 months ahead of schedule**

### The Bear Case (Don't Ignore This)

**NuScale's UAMPS Cancellation (2023):** The Utah project collapsed due to cost overruns. Critics declared SMRs dead. The stock cratered.

**Structural challenges:**
- **Cost:** SMRs haven't proven cost-competitive at scale yet
- **Time:** Most deployments won't happen until 2030s
- **History:** Large nuclear projects (Vogtle, V.C. Summer) plagued by delays and bankruptcies
- **Fuel:** HALEU (high-assay low-enriched uranium) supply chain barely exists

**Goldman Sachs reality check:** 85-90 GW of new nuclear needed by 2030 to meet demand. **<10% will be available globally.**

**The gap:** Nuclear solves the 2035+ problem, not the 2025-2030 problem. Natural gas and renewables must bridge.

## Part 4: The Uranium Geopolitics

### Supply Chain Concentration

| Country | % of US Uranium Imports (2024) |
|---------|-------------------------------|
| Kazakhstan | 24% |
| Canada | 22% |
| Australia | 12% |
| Russia | ~20% (restricted) |

### The Russia Problem

- US banned certain Russian uranium imports (waivers expire Jan 2028)
- Russia controls **~40% of global uranium enrichment** capacity
- Kazakhstan (top producer) has joint ventures with Russia
- SOMAÏR mine (Niger, Europe's supplier) — **no production reported in 2025** after coup

### Investment Implication

Uranium supply is tight and getting tighter. Domestic US production is a national security priority. Companies like **Uranium Energy Corp (UEC)** and **Cameco (CCJ)** benefit from both price appreciation and supply chain restructuring.

## Part 5: Investment Landscape

### The Tiers

**Tier 1: Uranium Producers (Commodity Exposure)**
| Ticker | Company | Thesis |
|--------|---------|--------|
| CCJ | Cameco | Largest Western producer. Dividends, stability. "Safe trade." |
| UEC | Uranium Energy Corp | Unhedged inventory. Wyoming production ramp. "Now trade." |
| UUUU | Energy Fuels | US producer. Rare earths diversification. |

**Tier 2: SMR Developers (High Risk/Reward)**
| Ticker | Company | Thesis |
|--------|---------|--------|
| SMR | NuScale Power | Only NRC-certified SMR. Revenue started. Volatile but real. |
| OKLO | Oklo | Sam Altman chaired. Micro-reactors. Pre-revenue. |

**Tier 3: Utilities/Operators**
| Ticker | Company | Thesis |
|--------|---------|--------|
| CEG | Constellation Energy | Largest US nuclear fleet. Microsoft partner. |
| VST | Vistra Corp | Meta nuclear deals. Diversified generation. |

### Risk Framework

| Play | Risk | Reward | Timeframe |
|------|------|--------|-----------|
| Uranium (CCJ, UEC) | Moderate | Moderate | 1-3 years |
| SMR developers (SMR, OKLO) | Very High | Very High | 3-10 years |
| Utilities (CEG, VST) | Low | Moderate | 1-5 years |

## Part 6: What Could Go Wrong

1. **SMR cost blow-ups:** Another UAMPS-style cancellation kills sentiment
2. **Regulatory reversal:** New administration slows NRC approvals
3. **Renewables + storage win:** Battery costs decline faster than expected
4. **Uranium supply glut:** Kazakhstan ramps production, crushes prices
5. **Demand miss:** AI scaling hits efficiency improvements, power demand disappoints
6. **Black swan:** Nuclear incident anywhere resets public perception

---

## The Cross-Disciplinary Angle

This story connects:
- **AI** (compute demand driver)
- **Energy** (infrastructure constraint)
- **Geopolitics** (uranium supply chains, Russia/China)
- **Finance** (hyperscaler capex, utility investments)
- **Policy** (Trump nuclear orders, NRC reform)
- **Climate** (carbon-free baseload necessity)

**The meta-insight:** The AI revolution is an energy revolution in disguise. Whoever solves power wins the AI race. Big tech understands this — that's why they're signing 20-year nuclear contracts.

---

## Summary

| Dimension | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| **Demand signal** | Strong — hyperscaler contracts are real money |
| **Technology** | Advancing — NuScale certified, Kairos building |
| **Timeline** | Slow — meaningful SMR capacity not until 2030s |
| **Investment** | Tiered — uranium now, SMRs for risk-tolerant |
| **Risks** | Execution, cost, regulatory, competition |

**Bottom line:** The nuclear renaissance is real, but it's a decade-long story, not a quarter-long trade. The smart money is positioning now for the 2030s buildout.
