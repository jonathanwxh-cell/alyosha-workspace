# The Nuclear-AI Renaissance: Power, GPUs, and the New Energy Moat

**Deep Dive | February 1, 2026**

---

## TL;DR

AI's insatiable power demand has triggered a nuclear renaissance. Hyperscalers are racing to secure baseload nuclear power through unprecedented deals—Microsoft restarting Three Mile Island, Amazon buying 1.9GW from Susquehanna, Meta announcing 6.6GW in nuclear procurement. This creates a "power moat" where only the largest balance sheets can compete. The bottleneck isn't reactors—it's the uranium supply chain, specifically enrichment capacity (50% controlled by Russia). Investment implications span utilities (CEG), uranium miners, SMR developers, and fuel cycle companies.

## The Problem: AI's Energy Crisis

Training GPT-4 consumed ~50 GWh. Running inference at scale requires 24/7 baseload power that solar and wind can't reliably provide. A single Blackwell GB200 NVL72 rack needs 120kW—a small office building's worth of power.

**The math is brutal:**
- Global AI data center power demand: ~50 GW (2025) → projected 150+ GW (2030)
- A single hyperscaler AI cluster can draw 1-2 GW—equivalent to a mid-sized city
- Intermittent renewables can't meet 99.999% uptime requirements

The result: Big Tech is pivoting from "100% renewable" marketing to "100% carbon-free baseload"—and that means nuclear.

## The Deals: A Nuclear Arms Race

### Microsoft + Constellation Energy (Three Mile Island)
- **Deal:** 20-year PPA for 835 MW from restarted Unit 1
- **Cost:** ~$16 billion total value
- **Timeline:** Targeting 2028 restart (accelerated from 2027)
- **Significance:** First US reactor restart for a single corporate client
- **DOE Loan:** $1 billion federal loan closed Nov 2025

### Amazon + Talen Energy (Susquehanna)
- **Deal:** 1.92 GW PPA + $500M SMR investment
- **Strategy:** Converting adjacent land into AI campus with direct nuclear connection

### Google + Kairos Power
- **Deal:** 500 MW SMR fleet, operational 2030-2035
- **Also:** 200 MW PPA with Commonwealth Fusion Systems (2025)
- **Strategy:** Betting on next-gen: SMRs + fusion hedging

### Meta + Vistra (January 2026)
- **Deal:** 6.6 GW nuclear procurement strategy
- **Scope:** Three existing plants + supporting multiple SMR projects
- **Project:** "Prometheus" AI data center initiative

## The Power Moat

This creates a profound competitive advantage:

1. **Cost predictability:** Nuclear PPAs lock in 20-year pricing vs. volatile spot power
2. **Reliability:** 90%+ capacity factor vs. 25-35% for solar/wind
3. **Carbon accounting:** Zero-emission baseload for ESG compliance
4. **Barrier to entry:** Startups can't replicate $16B power deals

> "The ability to power them reliably has become as important as the silicon itself."

Companies without nuclear access will face:
- Higher and more volatile energy costs
- Grid congestion and curtailment risk
- Stranded capex if power can't be secured

## The Bottleneck: Uranium Supply Chain

The limiting factor isn't reactor capacity—it's fuel. The supply chain has four stages:

| Stage | US Capability | Bottleneck? |
|-------|--------------|-------------|
| Mining (U-238) | ~5% domestic | ⚠️ Import-dependent |
| Conversion (to UF6 gas) | Limited | ⚠️ Global shortage |
| Enrichment (to U-235) | ~10% capacity | 🔴 **Critical** |
| Fabrication (fuel rods) | Self-sufficient | ✅ |

### The Russia Problem

**50% of global enrichment capacity is in Russia.**

The US banned Russian enriched uranium imports in 2024, but alternatives are scarce:
- US relies on 30% Russian enriched uranium historically
- Only two Western enrichment facilities exist
- Capacity expansion takes 5-7 years

### DOE Response

January 2026: $2.87 billion investment announced for domestic enrichment:
- Fund 3 US companies to reshore from foreign suppliers
- Develop LEU and HALEU production
- Support 94 existing commercial reactors + advanced reactor pipeline

**But:** Even fast-tracked, new capacity won't arrive before 2028-2030.

## The Investment Map

### Tier 1: Utilities (Direct Beneficiaries)

**Constellation Energy (CEG)**
- Largest US nuclear fleet operator
- Direct counterparty to Microsoft TMI deal
- "Picks and shovels" play on AI power demand
- Risk: Regulatory, rate case outcomes

**Vistra (VST)**
- Meta's 6.6 GW nuclear partner
- Diversified generation fleet
- Exposure to Texas grid dynamics

### Tier 2: Uranium & Fuel Cycle

**Cameco (CCJ)**
- Largest Western uranium producer
- Vertically integrated (mining + conversion)
- Benefits from supply deficit

**Centrus Energy (LEU)**
- Only US company licensed for HALEU enrichment
- Direct DOE funding recipient
- High risk/reward on enrichment buildout

**Uranium Energy Corp (UEC)**
- US-focused miner, in-situ recovery
- Domestic supply chain play

### Tier 3: SMR Developers (Speculative)

**NuScale Power (SMR)**
- Only NRC-approved SMR design
- But: No reactors sold yet, UAMPS project cancelled
- High volatility, execution risk

**BWX Technologies (BWXT)**
- TRISO fuel manufacturer for Kairos and others
- Defense/government nuclear exposure
- "Picks and shovels" for SMR sector

**Private:** Kairos Power, TerraPower, X-energy (watch for IPOs)

## Key Questions to Monitor

1. **TMI restart timeline:** Does Constellation hit 2028 target?
2. **Enrichment capacity:** Who wins DOE contracts? How fast can they scale?
3. **SMR deployments:** Will any SMR deliver power by 2030?
4. **Russia sanctions:** Further tightening? Alternative supply development?
5. **Regulatory:** NRC approval timelines for new reactor designs

---

## The Contrarian View

**Bull case:** Nuclear is the only carbon-free baseload that scales. AI demand is structural. Supply is constrained. Multi-year bull market for nuclear equities.

**Bear case:** 
- Reactor restarts are expensive and often delayed
- SMRs remain unproven at commercial scale
- Natural gas remains cheaper in many markets
- Fusion could leapfrog fission (long-term)

**My take:** The power moat thesis is real. Utilities with nuclear fleets (CEG, VST) are the safest plays. Uranium miners benefit from structural deficit. SMRs are venture-stage bets dressed in public market clothing.
