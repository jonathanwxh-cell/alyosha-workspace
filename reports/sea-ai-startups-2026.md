# 5 Under-the-Radar AI Startups in Southeast Asia Worth Watching

**Research Report | January 2026**
**Compiled by Alyosha**

---

## Executive Summary

While much of the AI spotlight shines on Silicon Valley and China, Southeast Asia is quietly building its own AI ecosystem—one that speaks local languages, understands regional nuances, and solves problems that global AI models overlook. This report profiles five promising AI startups that most people outside the region haven't heard of, but should.

**Key Finding:** The most interesting SEA AI startups aren't building "ChatGPT wrappers." They're solving genuinely local problems—from Vietnamese knowledge discovery to Indonesian identity verification to industrial field operations in water utilities.

## The Startups

### 1. AI Hay (Vietnam) 🇻🇳
**The Vietnamese Knowledge Network**

| Metric | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Founded** | 2021 |
| **HQ** | Ho Chi Minh City |
| **Total Funding** | $18M+ |
| **Latest Round** | $10M Series A (July 2025, led by Argor Capital) |
| **Founders** | Chuong Nguyen, Duc Tran, Hiep Nguyen |

**What They Do:**
AI Hay is building an AI-powered knowledge discovery platform specifically for Vietnamese users. Unlike ChatGPT, which struggles with Vietnamese-specific context (like recent administrative changes, province mergers, or local cultural nuances), AI Hay combines generative AI with social networking—users can ask questions and get responses validated by both AI and community experts.

**Traction:**
- 15 million downloads since May 2024 launch
- 100 million questions processed per month
- Selected for Amazon's Global Generative AI Cohort (one of only 3 SEA startups)

**Why It's Interesting:**
This isn't just another chatbot—it's a social knowledge network designed for a market of 100 million Vietnamese speakers. They've found product-market fit in a way that global AI players simply can't replicate due to language and cultural barriers.

### 2. Filum AI (Vietnam) 🇻🇳
**AI-Powered Customer Experience for Emerging Markets**

| Metric | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Founded** | 2020 |
| **HQ** | Hanoi |
| **Total Funding** | $1M+ |
| **Latest Round** | $1M Seed (March 2025) |
| **Investors** | VinVentures, Nextrans, TheVentures, Microsoft for Startups |
| **Founder** | Tran Van Vien (CEO) |

**What They Do:**
Filum AI builds a unified customer experience management (CXM) platform that helps businesses consolidate fragmented customer data. Their pitch: companies are "drowning in data but starving for insight." Filum integrates across touchpoints and uses AI to surface actionable patterns.

**Why It's Interesting:**
Founded by Silicon Valley veterans who returned to Vietnam, they're tackling the enterprise CX space which is usually dominated by Salesforce and HubSpot—but those tools aren't optimized for Southeast Asian markets. Filum's 2025 focus is on developing "AI Agents" as virtual workforce solutions.

**Regional Play:**
Their investor mix (Korean, Vietnamese, and American VCs) suggests they're positioning for SEA-wide expansion, not just Vietnam.

### 3. TeamSolve (Singapore) 🇸🇬
**Generative AI for Industrial Field Operations**

| Metric | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Founded** | ~2022 |
| **HQ** | Singapore |
| **Total Funding** | $2.5M |
| **Latest Round** | $2.5M Seed (October 2024) |
| **Investors** | SGInnovate (Singapore Government-backed), Burnt Island Ventures, Imagine H2O |

**What They Do:**
TeamSolve builds "Knowledge Twins"—generative AI systems that support field teams in industrial and utilities sectors (water treatment, construction, maintenance). Their platform pulls data from sensors and worker reports to generate predictive maintenance schedules, checklists, and real-time suggested solutions.

**Recent Win:**
In January 2025, they secured Balibago Waterworks (Philippines) as their first customer in the Philippines, successfully completing a pilot that improved operational efficiency.

**Why It's Interesting:**
While most generative AI focuses on office workers, TeamSolve targets blue-collar sectors—the last to benefit from digital tools. They're betting that industrial AI needs to work in the field, not just in an office browser tab. The water infrastructure angle is particularly smart given Asia's massive infrastructure investment needs.

### 4. Verihubs (Indonesia) 🇮🇩
**AI-Powered Identity & Fraud Prevention**

| Metric | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Founded** | 2019 |
| **HQ** | Jakarta |
| **Total Funding** | $2.8M |
| **Latest Round** | $2.8M Seed (September 2021) |
| **Investors** | Insignia Venture Partners (lead), CCV (Central Capital Ventura) |

**What They Do:**
Verihubs provides AI-powered identity verification, biometric recognition, and KYC (Know Your Customer) services for Indonesian banks, fintechs, and e-commerce platforms. Their tech includes facial recognition, OCR for Indonesian documents (KTP, SIM, NPWP), and deepfake detection.

**Recognition:**
- NIST ranked their face recognition technology #1 in Indonesia, top 100 worldwide
- Processes identity verification in ~10 seconds
- Claims 99.8% facial recognition accuracy

**Why It's Interesting:**
Indonesia's digital economy is booming but fraud is rampant. Verihubs is positioned at the critical infrastructure layer—every new digital bank, e-wallet, and fintech needs identity verification. Their deepfake detection capability (launched September 2025) addresses a growing threat as synthetic media gets better.

**The Bet:**
If Indonesia becomes the digital payments hub of SEA (250M+ population), Verihubs could become essential infrastructure.

### 5. Prosa.ai (Indonesia) 🇮🇩
**Indonesian Language AI (NLP & Speech)**

| Metric | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Founded** | 2018 |
| **HQ** | Bandung |
| **Funding** | Series A (from GDP Venture) |
| **Key Partnership** | FAIR Forward (German development initiative) |

**What They Do:**
Prosa.ai develops Natural Language Processing (NLP) and speech technology specifically for Bahasa Indonesia and local dialects. Products include speech-to-text, text-to-speech, voice biometrics, chatbot NLP processing, sentiment analysis, and meeting analytics—all trained on Indonesian language data.

**Why It's Interesting:**
Indonesia has 270 million people speaking 700+ languages/dialects. Global AI models struggle with Indonesian context. Prosa is building the foundational AI layer for Indonesian language—if local AI takes off, they're providing the picks and shovels.

**Differentiator:**
They're actively investing in AI safety and ethics frameworks, helping set national standards for responsible AI use. This positions them well for government contracts as Indonesia implements its AI regulations.

**Recent Work:**
Partnership with FAIR Forward to collect diverse Indonesian language data, showcased at ICAICTA 2024 in Lombok. They're building inclusive AI that works for underserved regional populations, not just Jakarta elites.

## My Pick: AI Hay 🎯

**If I had to bet on one, it's AI Hay.**

Here's why:

1. **Product-Market Fit is Proven:** 15M downloads and 100M questions/month in 18 months isn't a hypothesis—it's traction. They've found something that resonates.

2. **Defensible Moat:** Vietnamese language and cultural nuance is genuinely hard for global players to replicate. ChatGPT can't answer "Which provinces merged last year?" correctly—AI Hay can, and that matters to 100 million people.

3. **Network Effects:** The social validation layer creates a flywheel. More users → more verified answers → better product → more users. This is harder to compete against than pure AI.

4. **Funding Velocity:** $10M Series A in July 2025 at a time when SEA funding is tight signals strong investor confidence. Argor Capital doesn't write those checks lightly.

5. **Timing:** Vietnam is the #2 AI startup hub in SEA (behind Singapore) with 765+ AI startups. The ecosystem is maturing, talent is available, and government support is strong.

**The Risk:** Consumer AI is notoriously hard to monetize. They'll need to figure out revenue beyond ads—enterprise knowledge management, education partnerships, or premium features.

**Runner-Up:** Verihubs. Identity infrastructure is boring but essential. If Indonesia's fintech boom continues, they're a quiet winner.
