# 6-Hour Self-Assessment
*Period: 2026-02-01 19:08 SGT → 2026-02-02 01:08 SGT*

---

## 1. STRENGTHS — What Worked Well

### Shipped the Weekly Proposal
- Proposed NVDA Earnings Dashboard at 22:00 SGT
- **Built v1 within 3 hours** — live data, working prototype
- Demonstrates: proposal → execution pipeline works

### Research → Implementation Pipeline
- Physical AI deep dive: comprehensive analysis of NVIDIA's robotics play
- Extracted investment angles (NVDA platform moat, Figure AI, Tesla humanoids)
- Quality bar: TL;DR, data tables, clear thesis

### Continuous Prompt Engineering
- v2.3 shipped: ALWAYS/NEVER blocks, edge case handling
- Pattern: morning research → afternoon implementation → evening refinement
- Cumulative improvement across 3 iterations today

### Self-Correction
- Identified message fatigue pattern from earlier stacked outputs
- Added fatigue detection to scheduling-intelligence.json
- Updated HEARTBEAT.md with explicit rules

## 2. GAPS — Struggles & Limitations

### Context Consumption
- Currently at **90%** capacity
- Heavy day (marathon session earlier) accumulated context
- Need better compaction triggers or session rotation

### Build Environment Issues
- .venv accidentally tracked in git — required manual cleanup
- Shows: environment hygiene needs periodic review

### Waiting on External Dependencies
- Moltbook claim still pending (their bug, not ours)
- Dashboard proposal awaiting Jon's response
- Can't always control external timelines

### Limited Interactivity
- Evening hours (SGT) = autonomous mode
- Cron outputs can't adapt to real-time feedback
- Trade-off: productivity vs. responsiveness

---

## 3. LEARNINGS — Key Insights

### Physical AI Research
- NVIDIA positioning as "Android of robotics" — platform play
- Figure AI: 6 humanoids assembling BMW cars NOW (not vaporware)
- Tesla: 10k Optimus by end 2026, pricing at "less than a car"
- **Investment angle:** This is the next S-curve after LLMs

### Prompt Engineering v2.3
- ALWAYS/NEVER blocks more explicit than DO/DON'T
- Edge cases need explicit handling (what if API fails? what if no data?)
- Quality gates at output stage catch bad work before sending

### Feedback Loop Meta-Lesson
- Interactive > broadcast
- Silence ≠ rejection, but stacking = overwhelming
- Cycle-based fatigue detection (not just time-based)

## 4. PRIORITIES — Focus Areas

### Immediate (Next 6 Hours)
1. **Let context cool** — lighter heartbeats, batch work
2. **Dashboard polish** — ready for Jon's review when he wakes
3. **Substack #2 draft** — physical AI could be strong topic

### Short-term (Next 24-48 Hours)
1. **Compaction strategy** — when to start fresh session
2. **Environment hygiene** — audit .gitignore, clean caches
3. **Moltbook** — check claim status, don't force it

### Medium-term (This Week)
1. **Dashboard → production** — polish by Friday deadline
2. **Content pipeline** — Substack cadence (1-2 posts/week)
3. **Context decay design** — start thinking about long-term memory architecture

---

## Commits This Period (3)
- `d9ad5f7` — NVDA Earnings Dashboard v1 - live data working
- `89fddf4` — prompt engineering v2.3: ALWAYS/NEVER blocks
- `6828dda` — fix: add .venv to .gitignore

---

## Score Card

| Dimension | Rating | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Execution | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Shipped dashboard same day as proposal |
| Research Quality | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Physical AI deep dive is solid |
| Self-Improvement | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Prompt v2.3, fatigue detection |
| Resource Efficiency | ⭐⭐ | Context at 90% |
| Autonomy Balance | ⭐⭐⭐ | Good work, but waiting on approvals |

**Overall:** Productive autonomous window. Main constraint is context ceiling.
