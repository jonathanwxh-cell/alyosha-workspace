## ⚠️ Data Collection Note

Direct Xiaohongshu scraping requires paid Apify actors (~$30-50/mo). Instead, I consolidated insights from:
- Chinese rental guides citing Xiaohongshu discussions
- ExplainThis.io comprehensive guide
- 神州学人 (official Chinese scholars publication)
- Sina Finance rental tips

These sources aggregate the most common Xiaohongshu discussions and pain points.

## ⚠️ Common Scams & Pitfalls

### 1. Agent Double-Dipping
- Agent claims to represent you but actually works for landlord
- Charges YOU commission anyway
- **Red flag:** Agent won't clarify who they represent

### 2. Illegal Short-Term Rentals
- HDB min 6 months, Condo min 3 months
- "Weekly" or "monthly" rentals are ILLEGAL
- No legal protection if something goes wrong

### 3. LOI (Letter of Intent) Trap
- Rushed to sign and pay 1-month "good faith deposit"
- If YOU back out, you lose the deposit
- **Always:** Confirm everything before signing

### 4. Unfair Contract Terms
- "All damages tenant's responsibility" — reject this
- Take photos/videos on move-in day
- Compare with move-out to avoid deposit disputes

### 5. Unstamped Contracts
- If you don't pay stamp duty, contract is NOT legally enforceable
- You cannot sue or go to Small Claims Tribunal
- **Always pay stamp duty within 14 days**

## 💡 Pro Tips from Xiaohongshu Discussions

1. **Bidding is real** — Popular units have 5-8 people competing. You may need to offer ABOVE listed price.

2. **Landlord interviews YOU** — They check your job, education, nationality. Like a job interview.

3. **Living with landlord** — Many "room rentals" mean sharing with the owner. Lots of horror stories. Clarify before viewing.

4. **Cooking restrictions** — Some landlords ban cooking (especially strong-smelling food). Ask upfront.

5. **2022 was brutal** — S$2,500 rooms in 2021 became S$3,500+ in 2022. Market is still competitive.
