## Executive Summary

The convergence of AI infrastructure demands and nuclear power represents one of the most significant investment themes of this decade. Big Tech has committed **$50B+** to nuclear power in the past 12 months alone. This isn't just a trend—it's a structural shift driven by physics: AI requires 24/7 baseload power that renewables cannot provide, and nuclear is the only scalable, carbon-free option.

**Key Thesis:** The AI capex boom is creating a parallel nuclear renaissance. Early movers in uranium, SMR developers, and legacy nuclear operators will capture asymmetric returns.

## Part 1: The Demand Shock

### AI Power Consumption is Exploding

| Metric | 2024 | 2030 | 2035 |
|--------|------|------|------|
| Global DC electricity (TWh) | 460 | 1,000+ | 1,300 |
| U.S. electricity demand growth | Flat (20 yrs) | +15% (5 yrs) | +25%+ |
| Data center share of U.S. power | ~3% | ~8% | ~12% |

*Source: IEA, Grid Strategies, Goldman Sachs*

**Goldman Sachs estimates:** Data center electricity demand could rise **160% by 2030**.

### Why This Matters

A single hyperscale AI data center consumes 100-500 MW. Training large models requires **gigawatt-scale** sustained power. For context:
- GPT-4 training: ~50 GWh total
- GPT-5 (estimated): 200+ GWh
- A 1 GW nuclear plant produces ~8,760 GWh/year

The math is clear: one nuclear plant can train multiple frontier AI models *per year* with power to spare.

## Part 2: Big Tech's Nuclear Pivot

### The Deals (Past 12 Months)

| Company | Deal | Capacity | Investment | Timeline |
|---------|------|----------|------------|----------|
| **Microsoft** | Three Mile Island restart (Constellation) | 835 MW | $16B (20-yr PPA) | 2028 |
| **Amazon** | Susquehanna AI campus | 1.6 GW+ | $20B+ | Ongoing |
| **Amazon** | X-Energy SMR investment | 5 GW target | $500M+ led round | 2030s |
| **Google** | Kairos Power SMR fleet | 500 MW | Undisclosed | 2030-2035 |
| **Meta** | Vistra nuclear plants + RFP | 6+ GW | Multi-billion | 2030s |
| **Oracle** | SMR-powered gigawatt DC | 1 GW | TBD | TBD |

**Total committed:** 10+ GW of new/restarted nuclear capacity in the U.S. alone.

### Why Nuclear Over Renewables?

| Factor | Solar/Wind | Natural Gas | Nuclear |
|--------|------------|-------------|---------|
| Capacity factor | 25-35% | 40-60% | **90%+** |
| Carbon-free | Yes | No | **Yes** |
| 24/7 baseload | No | Yes | **Yes** |
| Land use (per GW) | 5,000-10,000 acres | 50 acres | **1 acre** |
| Lifespan | 25-30 years | 30-40 years | **60-80 years** |

Nuclear is the **only** technology that satisfies all three requirements: carbon-free, 24/7, and scalable.

### The Microsoft/Three Mile Island Story

Nearly 50 years after the partial meltdown made Three Mile Island synonymous with nuclear disaster, Microsoft is bringing it back online to power AI.

**Key details:**
- 20-year, $16B power purchase agreement
- 837 MW capacity (100% to Microsoft)
- Renamed "Crane Clean Energy Center"
- Target restart: 2028
- The restarting reactor (Unit 1) was NOT involved in 1979 accident
- June 2025: Governor Shapiro appeared with Constellation & Microsoft executives

**Why it matters:** This signals nuclear's rehabilitation is complete. The most famous nuclear disaster site will power the AI future.

## Part 3: Small Modular Reactors (SMRs)

### The Next Frontier

SMRs are factory-built, smaller reactors (50-300 MW each) that promise:
- Faster construction (3-5 years vs 10+ for conventional)
- Lower upfront capital
- Modular scaling
- Enhanced safety features
- Siting flexibility (near data centers)

### Key Players

| Company | Technology | Backing | First Commercial |
|---------|------------|---------|-----------------|
| **X-Energy** | TRISO fuel, gas-cooled | Amazon $500M+, DOE | 2030s |
| **Kairos Power** | Molten salt, TRISO | Google, DOE | 2030 (demo) |
| **NuScale** | Light water SMR | DOE $1.4B | 2030s |
| **TerraPower** | Sodium-cooled | Bill Gates | 2030 |

### TRISO Fuel: The Game Changer

Both X-Energy and Kairos use **TRISO (Tri-structural Isotropic) particle fuel**:
- Uranium encapsulated in graphite kernels (poppy seed size)
- Withstands extreme temperatures
- Cannot melt even in worst-case scenarios
- Eliminates need for large containment structures
- 20 years of DOE testing

**Investment implication:** TRISO fuel manufacturing is a critical bottleneck. X-Energy's Oak Ridge facility could become strategically important.

### Regulatory Tailwinds

Trump Administration (May 2025):
- 4 executive orders accelerating nuclear
- Target: 100 GW → 400 GW U.S. capacity by 2050
- 10 new large reactors under construction by 2030
- Streamlined NRC licensing timelines

**NuScale milestone:** Standard Design Approval for 462 MW SMR issued May 2025—two months ahead of schedule.

## Part 4: Global Nuclear Expansion

### 2026: The Inflection Year

After a weak 2025 (only 2 reactors online, 7 shut down), BloombergNEF expects **15 reactors** to come online in 2026, adding ~12 GW.

### China's Dominance

| Metric | China | U.S. |
|--------|-------|------|
| Reactors in operation | 57 | 93 |
| Under construction | ~25 | 2 |
| 2025 investment | ¥146.9B (~$20B) | ~$5B |
| Nuclear share of power (2024) | 5% | 18% |
| Nuclear share (2040 target) | 10% | ? |

**Key development:** China's Linglong One SMR—first commercial onshore SMR globally—scheduled for H1 2026 operations.

**Geopolitical angle:** China is building nuclear capacity at 5x the U.S. pace. If AI compute becomes a national security asset, nuclear power access becomes strategic infrastructure.

### U.S. Restarts & Extensions

| Plant | Status | Significance |
|-------|--------|--------------|
| **Palisades (MI)** | Restart early 2026 | First U.S. restart from decommissioning |
| **Three Mile Island** | Restart 2028 | Most symbolic nuclear revival |
| **Diablo Canyon (CA)** | Life extension | Reversed shutdown decision |

The Palisades restart, backed by $1.52B federal loan, represents a policy shift: **preserve and extend** rather than decommission.

## Part 5: The Uranium Investment Case

### Supply-Demand Imbalance

**Sprott forecast:** 197 million lb supply deficit by 2040.

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Kazatomprom (40% of global supply) | Cut 2025-2026 guidance by 20M+ lbs |
| Cameco (Canada) | Production constraints, not ramping |
| U.S. domestic production | 46-47M lb/year deficit vs requirements |
| Russian enrichment ban | Disrupting fuel cycle |
| Utility contracting | 10 months of anemic activity in 2025 |

### Price Dynamics

| Metric | Current | Bull Case Target |
|--------|---------|------------------|
| Spot price (U3O8) | ~$78/lb | - |
| Cameco ceiling estimate | - | $140-150/lb |
| Analyst bull case | - | $100-200/lb |
| Mining equities (2025) | +40% avg | - |

**Key insight from Sprott:** "There's a stalemate. Utilities need to buy, producers refuse to sell at current prices. Contracting has been anemic, but will be pushed into the future. They will ultimately have to pay up."

### Investment Vehicles

**Pure-play uranium:**
- **Sprott Physical Uranium Trust (SRUUF)** — Direct physical exposure
- **Cameco (CCJ)** — Largest Western producer
- **Kazatomprom (KAP.IL)** — Largest global producer (geopolitical risk)
- **NexGen Energy (NXE)** — High-grade Arrow deposit
- **Uranium Energy Corp (UEC)** — U.S. producer

**Nuclear operators:**
- **Constellation Energy (CEG)** — Largest U.S. nuclear fleet, Microsoft deal
- **Vistra (VST)** — Meta deals, diversified
- **Cameco** — Vertically integrated

**SMR developers (speculative):**
- **NuScale (SMR)** — Only NRC-approved SMR design
- **Oklo (OKLO)** — Sam Altman-backed, DOE support

## Part 6: Risks & Contrarian Considerations

### Bear Case

1. **Construction delays:** SMRs are unproven at commercial scale; NuScale's Utah project was cancelled in 2023 due to cost overruns and lack of customers.

2. **Cost overruns:** Nuclear capex is 5-10x natural gas ($6,400-12,700/kW vs $1,290/kW).

3. **Regulatory reversal:** Political winds could shift; NRC remains conservative.

4. **AI demand slowdown:** If inference efficiency improves faster than expected, power demand projections may be too high.

5. **Natural gas bridge:** Gas is faster to deploy; hyperscalers are signing gas deals too.

### Talebian Lens

**Hidden fragility:** The nuclear supply chain is concentrated. Kazatomprom (Kazakhstan) controls 40% of global uranium. Russian sanctions have disrupted enrichment. A single supply disruption could spike prices.

**Convexity:** Uranium miners have limited downside (production cuts provide floor) but significant upside if AI demand materializes as projected. Optionality is cheap.

**Barbell position:** 
- Safe end: Constellation Energy (profitable now, Microsoft deal locked in)
- Convex end: NuScale or Oklo (binary outcomes, massive upside if SMRs work)
