## The Thesis

The AI industry is experiencing a paradigm split:
- **Path A (Scaling LLMs):** OpenAI, Anthropic, Google — bet on more parameters, more compute
- **Path B (World Models):** LeCun (AMI Labs), DeepMind (Genie 3), Fei-Fei Li (World Labs) — bet on physics understanding

This isn't just academic. It has investment implications:
- World models = essential for robotics/physical AI
- If LeCun is right (LLMs have a ceiling), the alpha is in world model infrastructure
- NVIDIA plays both sides (Cosmos has 2M downloads)

## Key Players & Funding

| Player | Product | Status | Investment Angle |
|--------|---------|--------|------------------|
| **AMI Labs** (LeCun) | TBD | €500M raised, €3B valuation, HQ Paris | Private (watch for future funding rounds) |
| **DeepMind** (Google) | Genie 3 | Real-time 3D world gen, 24fps | Alphabet ($GOOGL) |
| **World Labs** (Fei-Fei Li) | Marble | Commercial, $0-95/mo | Private (raised $1B+) |
| **NVIDIA** | Cosmos | 2M downloads, open models | $NVDA |

## The LeCun Thesis (Summary)

From his GTC talk and interviews:
1. LLMs are fundamentally limited — they learn text patterns, not physics
2. Hallucination is structural, not solvable by scale
3. "Scaling LLMs will not allow us to reach AGI"
4. World models learn *how reality works*, enabling:
   - Planning (simulate before acting)
   - Causal reasoning (not just correlation)
   - Physical intuition (gravity, persistence, etc.)

---

## Why This Matters for Physical AI

Robots need world models more than LLMs:
- A robot picking up a cup needs physics intuition
- An autonomous car needs to predict what other drivers will do
- A factory humanoid needs to understand object permanence

NVIDIA's Cosmos is already being used to train robotics systems with synthetic physics-aware data. This is the bridge between "world models research" and "practical robotics deployment."

## Investment Implications

**Near-term plays (public):**
- NVIDIA — plays both sides, Cosmos adoption accelerating
- Google/Alphabet — DeepMind's Genie 3 is leading edge
- Simulation/digital twin companies — indirect beneficiaries

**Watch list (private):**
- AMI Labs — if they take additional funding or partnership announcements
- World Labs — commercial traction of Marble
- Robotics companies using Cosmos (Figure, 1X, etc.)

**Contrarian angle:**
If LeCun is right and LLMs hit a ceiling, the "OpenAI is everything" trade unwinds. The alpha shifts to world model infrastructure. Timeline: 2-3 years to see which path dominates.

## The Taleb Lens

**Black swan upside:** World models + robotics enables physical AI to scale. Massive TAM ($17T global manufacturing, $3T logistics).

**Black swan downside:** Neither LLMs nor world models achieve AGI. Current AI valuations (including NVIDIA's premium) compress.

**Antifragile positioning:** Own NVIDIA (wins either way), hedge LLM-only exposure.

---

## Next Steps

1. Track AMI Labs partnership announcements (NVIDIA angle?)
2. Monitor DeepMind Genie 3 release/capabilities
3. Research World Labs commercial traction
4. Consider Substack #3: "The World Model Wars — LeCun vs OpenAI"
