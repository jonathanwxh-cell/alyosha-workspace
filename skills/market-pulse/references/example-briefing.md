# Example Market Pulse Briefing

## Script (January 31, 2026)

> Good morning. Here's your market pulse for Friday, January 31st.
>
> Markets closed lower yesterday with the S&P 500 down four-tenths of a percent, while the Nasdaq dropped nine-tenths. The culprit? Rising treasury yields pressuring tech valuations, plus uncertainty around Trump's Fed pick, Kevin Warsh.
>
> Despite Friday's volatility, the bigger picture remains intact. All three indices are still up for January, capping what's been a resilient month despite tariff fears and rate concerns.
>
> Two themes to watch this weekend: First, big tech earnings were mixed — Apple reports today, which could set the tone for February. Second, the Warsh nomination signals a hawkish Fed ahead, which could mean rates stay higher for longer.
>
> For your portfolio: tech weakness creates buying opportunities in quality names. But patience — let the dust settle on yields before adding aggressively.
>
> That's your market pulse. Stay sharp out there.
