# Industry Analysis Framework

## Porter's 5 Forces — Applied

| Force | Questions | Low Risk | High Risk |
|-------|-----------|----------|-----------|
| **Rivalry** | Who competes? Price or innovation? | Oligopoly, differentiated | Price wars, commoditized |
| **Substitutes** | What replaces this? How fast? | High switching costs | Easy alternatives |
| **Buyer power** | Concentrated customers? | Fragmented | Top 4 = 50%+ revenue |
| **Supplier power** | Single-source risk? | Multiple sources | TSMC-style dependency |
| **Entry barriers** | What stops competition? | Network effects, IP, scale | Just capital |

## Industry Cycle Position

| Stage | Characteristics | Investment Implication |
|-------|-----------------|------------------------|
| **Early growth** | High growth, negative/low margins, land grab | High risk, high reward |
| **Growth** | Strong growth, improving margins, scaling | Sweet spot for growth investors |
| **Mature** | Stable growth, high margins, cash generation | Value/dividend focus |
| **Decline** | Negative growth, margin pressure, disruption | Avoid or deep value play |

## Disruption Risk Assessment

1. **What technology could disrupt in 3-5 years?**
2. **Who are the insurgent competitors?**
3. **Is incumbent adapting or resisting?**
4. **How fast is disruption happening?**
