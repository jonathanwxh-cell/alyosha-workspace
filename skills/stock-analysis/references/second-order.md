# Second-Order Thinking Framework

## The 6 Questions

Before any investment, answer:

### 1. What's the consensus?
- What does the market believe?
- If you agree with consensus, where's your edge?
- Consensus can be right — but no alpha in agreeing

### 2. What's priced in?
- What growth rate is embedded in valuation?
- What margin assumptions?
- What probability of success?
- Back-calculate expectations from current price

### 3. What would change consensus?
- What event/data would flip the narrative?
- Earnings surprise? Competitive move? Regulatory change?
- How likely is this catalyst?
- What's the timing?

### 4. Who's on the other side?
- Who's selling and why?
- Forced sellers (redemptions, rebalancing)?
- Informed sellers (insiders, competitors)?
- Different time horizons?

### 5. What are the second-order effects?
- If X happens, then Y, then Z...
- Who benefits from my thesis being right?
- Who gets hurt?
- What are the ripple effects?

### 6. Pre-mortem
Imagine it's 2 years later and you've lost 50%:
- What went wrong?
- What should you have seen?
- What warning signs did you ignore?
- What question didn't you ask?

## Non-Consensus Matrix

| You | Consensus | Outcome |
|-----|-----------|---------|
| Bullish | Bullish | No edge (even if right) |
| Bearish | Bearish | No edge (even if right) |
| Bullish | Bearish | Edge if right |
| Bearish | Bullish | Edge if right |

**The goal:** Be non-consensus AND right.

## Time Horizon Mismatch

Often the edge is seeing something the market will eventually see:

| Your Horizon | Market Horizon | Opportunity |
|--------------|----------------|-------------|
| 3 years | 1 quarter | Long-term thesis |
| 1 month | 1 year | Near-term catalyst |
| Infinite | 5 years | Compounders |

## Variant Perception

Ask: "What do I believe that the market doesn't?"

Strong variant perceptions:
- Based on primary research (not just reading)
- Specific and falsifiable
- Has a catalyst to be revealed
- Explains why market is wrong

Weak variant perceptions:
- "Market is dumb"
- Based on hope/fear
- No specific insight
- No catalyst
